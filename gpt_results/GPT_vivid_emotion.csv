0,0,"June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. 

We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. 

My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 

4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. 

My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. 

The celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever.",2,2
1,1,"Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. 

In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. 

In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. 

In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",2,2
2,100,"Full disclosure: I'm an alumni and these things occurred years ago, but I wanted to share nonetheless. I was pretty successful in college- good grades, good research, etc.- but because of that, I always felt like... I had no right to be sad. 

In college, we're of the age where our parents are starting to get sick- cancer, Huntington's, and other diseases. But even after finding out about stuff like that, I found it so hard to feel sad and share with anyone. 

Any time I was able to summon the courage to talk to a friend, they would be struggling with psets and exams and... I never felt right adding on to their struggles with my own. As ridiculous as it sounds, I could just imagine people looking at me and thinking, """"I have a crisis over here and you're doing so well, why the hell do you look sad"""". 

I learned to suppress my emotions so well that eventually I could no longer feel unless I was under some kind of influence. Fast forward through some really bad incidents with substances and I finally found the courage to get help. 

I know some people have had very bad experiences with mental health services so maybe I was just lucky. All I can say is, I'm sure other current students feel this way. And people always remark about how surprised they are that so and so was depressed. But getting help is definitely worth a try. 

And if your friends are really friends at all, it won't matter if they are also having a bad time. You guys can always have bad times together.",3,3
3,1002,"I'm an Assistant Professor in Astronomy and I study the dynamic universe. So what I do is, with the beautiful telescopes here at Palomar Observatory, we have some robotic telescopes that are continuously making a movie of the night sky. So we image the sky over and over again and we look for what changed. You might go out there and think the universe is the same old thing every time, but it's actually not. It's full of these little explosions, which last for a very short amount of time, so they're very energetic. It's like cosmic fireworks lighting up our sky. 

It was not at all clear that one day I would do a PhD. I grew up on a farm in India with 100 cows and fields of weeds and chick peas. And I had left home when I was 15, and I was a girl in India in a small place. The entire community was up in arms. There were people like neighbors, relatives, you name it. People I haven't even seen before coming into the house and trying to talk my parents out of this crazy decision to send their daughter alone on this journey into the other end of the world to pursue something called Astronomy or whatever that was. The community was completely unsupportive. 

In my case, the best way to deal with it was to just let that fade away in the background and not engage with it directly, but focus on what is motivating me, on what is giving me joy and just let everything else just fade away in the background.",3,3
4,1003,"All I wanted to do when I grew up was live at the beach. That's what drove me. I just wanna live at the beach when I grow up. I ended up getting two degrees. First degree I got in psychology, which I don't do a whole lot with now. But when I went through school, there was a lot of writing involved and a lot of communication, and I think that's helped me now. 

But I wasn't really passionate about that. I kinda went through the motions a little bit in school, that first time around. I loved being in college. I loved hanging with my friends. I loved playing sports, but I was never really all that enthusiastic about my curriculum at that point. 

A lot of times when I should have been studying for midterms or something like that, I was trying to figure out what the waves are doing, and why they worked. In the end, I ended up going back to school for meteorology. It was really rewarding, because I loved what I was doing, and I wanted to study , and I looked forward to it. 

And that was different than when I was 20. At a certain point, life takes over, and you have to get a job and figure out what it is you're gonna do. But you don't necessarily have to figure out what you're going to do for the rest of your life at 20.",2,2
5,1006,"When I started, I didn't know that I wanted to be in pharma. I love the industry for what it can do. I actually hated how they got it done. I didn't love the formula of the business practices in pharma, which is why I started my own. But the truth is, along the path, I was in an industry that was mostly male-dominated. If I looked up in the organization, nobody looked like me. There wasn't a lot of female leadership, there still isn't today. 

So my best way to make change is to be a leader in the industry. When I was on the path with Addyi, people called it the little pink pill. And they would say, aww, the little pink pill. And isn't that cute? When I realized that there was so much dismissiveness underneath it, I started showing up in blazing hot pink. 

It's the gender stereotype. Instead of coming back from it, I'm going straight for it, so we can talk about it. I think if you feel like you don't fit in the system, the way to make your way into it is to surprise people and continue to show up. Never let that underestimation shake your confidence in what you're set out to do.",2,2
6,1007,"So I went to college on a scholarship. And my whole world at that time was really focused around the Olympics. I wanted to be on the Olympic team. I majored in marketing and business management during my college because I knew that I would have to do something beyond it, but what it was going to be, I had no idea. I really didn't have a clue. 

And then while my wife was working on Jurassic Park -- she was doubling the little girl in Jurassic Park -- Cirque du Soleil was in Santa Monica. They had an audition going on at the pier. And she went and they wanted her, and they were looking for a guy that had trampoline background and I sent my video tape of some shows that I had done, the diving and trampoline shows combined, and they liked it. 

And so they invited us to join Cirque du Soleil. I guess the only advice then, from that, that I can look back and say that I tried to do was to have a passion for what I was doing. Regardless of whether you know exactly what it's gonna be or not, if what you do is your passion, it never feels like a job.",2,2
7,1011,"I come from a large family, and my mother had to drop out of school at an early age and start a family. There were seven of us. I think that reality hit us a lot earlier. When I was a kid, I was young, but the The Watts Riots happened. I remember just watching our neighborhood on fire. We would turn on the news at night and we would see our neighborhood and commentators talking about it. 

It's almost like not your whole childhood is gone, but a big piece of it is and it's called the innocence. Once the innocence is gone it's like welcome to the real world. 

Going on to college and getting college degrees and advanced degrees, I never stopped and thought about my circumstance being any excuse for why I wasn't supposed to do those things. You may not be clear in your purpose now. Don't let it be determined by anybody else's clock. 

Somewhere in your journeys, discover who you really are. Not who your mother, your father said you were. Not who your community said you were. Not who this country tried to say that you were, as a woman, or as poor, or as Latino, or African-American. As who you discover you really are. This can only come about as a result of process, this journey.",3,3
8,1012,"I wanted to make wine. And I found this guy who helped me and he was a great master of wine. And so I went out where the winery is right now and I was just looking around and there's a flat spot, and I built the whole winery around where someone would stand at the tasting bar and look out the window and see Bridge Creek Wall, which is the highest rock wall in Icicle Canyon. 

It took about ten years to build that winery. It took four years to lay the stone on it. Just walk out in the yard here and pick up stone. We did that for four years and laid it up on that building. 

I was poor. When you're poor, you do stuff yourself. And now you know I'm making 100 barrels a year and living on 25 acres of property out in the middle of nowhere. We're four miles off the power grid. 

You need to make the first step. It's like going for a run, you gotta get your shoes on. You gonna get out and there start doing it, don't be afraid to make mistakes. You just gonna start doing what you wanna do.",2,2
9,1018,"I am the marketing director here at Valen Analytics. Our company builds predictive models and we also have a platform that hosts them that integrates into the company workflows for property and casualty companies. So the predictive models basically allow them to better price and select risks, so yeah, I do the execution of the marketing campaigns and the coordination with inside sales. 

So I graduated, and then I worked in the mental health industry for a while. And decided that that was not good for my own mental health, it was very stressful, very taxing. So I went to went back to school, got my masters in marketing, I thought that I was gonna be able to graduate and step right into a marketing job but there was a lot more business acumen that needed to be developed before I was really prepared for that. 

I had to be humbled and grounded a bit more to realize, yeah, you have a foundation. But that foundation, the degree is not your golden ticket into the chocolate factory. The degree is what may help open the door but you've got to earn your way the rest of the way. 

So the way I interpreted that is, I need to make sure that I'm really putting forward the solid performance at what I'm doing now and then set forth my next goal.",2,2
10,1021,"My family loves and admires my talent for art. When I wanted to go to college, I wanted to move to Philadelphia to go to art school. No one was really supportive of that, except my mother. They thought it was too far away and too expensive. They thought I was a great artist, but they thought I should do something more reasonable and stay in Oklahoma. 

I think the rest of my family has come around now, but in the beginning, they weren't very supportive of that. I think how my art allows me to exercise my purpose and affect the world is something I'm still figuring out. Not just what type of artist do I want to be, but what type of woman do I wanna be. 

Because when I was younger, when I was in college, it was like I want to change the world. I wanna be this huge artist. I want to change people's lives. I want to change the world, which is a really grand idea. 

I think that's possible, but I think you have to start with yourself as corny as that sounds. You don't just change the world, you change yourself or your friends, your circle. You influence these people and you inspire these people and if more people did that, we'd all have a better understanding of what other people go through.",2,2
11,1035,"Sophomore year was that critical year where everything kind of just hit me that you really have to take ownership of this education thing. The investment you're making in time and money has a lot of risk or potential to be wasted. And I didn't have the good fortune of something being given to me on the back end in terms of a family business or something I could fall back on. I really had to make something happen in school. That wasn't very clear to me, that freshman, first part of sophomore year. 

But the sophomore year came to a close. I started to get my act together a little bit and find that direction. It's really about being drawn to the next adventure in career or life. Some of the most impactful job changes weren't necessarily going to the next higher level of responsibility, but really more what people might consider lateral moves. Those lateral moves really had an impact on expanding my breadth of experience, my understanding. 

When you're not driven just by the financial rewards, but you're driven by the broader set of rewards, how it makes you feel inside, how you can impact people around you. I feel those are the things that really start to hit home in terms of making the right choices. I think we all have to find that path for ourselves, though.",2,2
12,1036,"I went to community college. I didn't really know what I wanted to do at that point, couldn't figure it out. I had a lot of things on my mind, pressures from family wanting me to go into med school. 

Finally I decided to take one more step, go out of community college, and enter university. I applied for University of Manila, got in, and went straight into my bachelor's degree for mechanical engineering. It took me about seven years, mainly because although I wanted to go into mechanical engineering, I got to that point where, I actually still didn't know whether I wanted to continue pursuing that degree. I was always pushed towards going to medical school. I wanted to move the opposite way. 

I went more towards technology, and towards the mechanical aspects of it. Engineering is vast and diverse. I could've gone into any field, civil, mechanical, electrical, systems. I chose mechanical because I like to be hands on, I liked things that move. 

Find the time to explore, to get to know yourself. I think that was the best thing for me to finally decide this is the career path that I want. I doubted myself throughout my entire college career whether or not I wanted to continue this. It wasn't until I got out of it and actually took time to myself to figure out to see this is actually where I wanna go.",2,2
13,1038,"I started out as a graphic designer. So I went to college studying graphic design and journalism. And once I graduated, I did the whole traditional job thing. I worked at radio stations and advertising firms and I was laid off from one of my positions. 

And I'm like, crap, what do I do now? So I had this idea to do a pop-up store where we would have a rotating collection of local artists and designers come in and install something for a month. And then switch out and then another artist will come in and do something. 

There was a contest where you go in and you present your idea and you walk away with small money, and that's what I did. I presented it and I won the best creative idea. And I used that seed money to open up the little pop-up shop. 

You just have to push yourself a little bit harder, but in the end it paid off. And obviously I don't win things all the time. I lose more than I win, but it only takes that one time to win where I'm like yes, this was so worth it. So, just don't waste any opportunities.",2,2
14,1040,"I was very blessed to have some really good surroundings around me. Obviously being in Chicago there were some negative things as well. I was never a perfect kid, but I had to learn my rights and wrongs and learn from some of the bumps and bruises I had along the way. I realize that getting in trouble wasn't the way that I enjoyed it because that took me away from the things I wanted to do. Playing sports, being with my friends, all those different things that brought joy for me. 

I ended up going to college at the University of Illinois at Chicago. That's what helped shape me to where I am today. The cool thing about going to the college setting is you get to pick what you wanna study. Understanding the different things that you like and saying okay, how can I learn about that because I am passionate about it. I wanna learn about this, even though the class might be difficult. 

The more I'm able to retain and understand, the more joy I'm gonna be able to get out of that, so figure out what that is because that's gonna be different for you everyone.",2,2
15,105,"It's ok to get that B/C/D/F. It's very natural to stress out over your grades, they're really the only quantitative/objective(ish) measure of your performance that you get. Especially first year students where maybe you breezed through zoom highschool and then got just totally slapped by the monstrosity that is college. Your feelings and difficulty coping are totally valid. 

It takes quite a bit of time to really internalize that you are not your GPA and to unlink it from your idea of self worth. It is however a journey that is worth starting early because life becomes much happier once you get there. Every one of my friends has done poorly in classes or on exams here and they are still very successful in life (arguably more so than I am). You can still get into the highest tier schools/jobs/med schools with a GPA that isn't amazing. 

Some of them though still can't come back to campus >5 years later without massive anxiety and panic because they understand that grades don't matter to anyone else but haven't internally let themselves off the hook yet. It's really sad. You're not your GPA. I really do think it's worth spending a few minutes a month or so thinking about this until it hits home. It might take you a year but future you will be very thankful. 

Some of you will understand this and be unable to act on it because external familial pressure is what's driving this issue. To those I wish I had a solution but just understand that your parents are human too and they can totally be wrong. They try to do the best they can but they don't magically have all the answers and they don't really know what it's like to be you and the lasting effects that this kind of pressure can cause. Their longitudinal study on parenting isn't concluded yet and it's really hard to alter your path part way through and simply too late once it's concluded. 

There are enough sources of mental stresses in this world and this doesn't have to be one of them. I've had friends totally flunk their classes then walk away with starting salaries that just baffle me. The two really are not as coupled as you'd think.",2,2
16,1060,"I'm currently a narrative creator and game designer for Niantic. Prior to that I was in film school. When I was in undergrad, I got interested in games, I got interested in game design. I took all the game design courses, I'm the only one there who's done all of these. They start to call on me to TA all of these classes. 

They pull in a guy named Flint Dille, and he's teaching a class on alternate reality games. We worked well together, we go our separate ways and then two years later, he is starting to do this project and he needs a guy who can help him, and he calls me. 

I ended up here by pushing in a direction I found interesting and Niantic is very much focused on developing the intellectual property that we own, which is Ingress. We're developing and building this really deep and rich and interconnected sort of science fiction world. 

There was always the risk that I'm driving the primal force of my energy and interest into an area with no guarantees. But I was hedging the risk by just learning constantly, learning how to do new stuff. At some point you end up with so many tools on your toolbelt that you know that if you're backed into a corner you can reach down to the utility belt and be like I know how to do this!",2,2
17,1062,"I knew I wanted to be a police officer. I went in and filled out the application, and they laughed at me. Who's gonna give an 18-year-old kid a gun? But what they did do was give me a parking ticket book and allowed me to work for the police department writing parking tickets, so that's what I did. 

And while I was writing parking tickets, every day, I would go into the roll call room and look at their Most Wanted board. And one day I saw a bank robber, who I actually knew, and I ended up helping the FBI solve a bank robbery. 

Shortly thereafter, I ended up going to the police academy, joined the local department to get some experience, and when I was old enough and I had my education behind me, I came into the FBI. 

When I got my credentials in my hand and I knew that I was an FBI agent,that was it. There was no turning back. 

You gotta look into yourself. What is it that I like to do? What am I good at doing? And once you decide what you like, focus on that. Set your goals, set your objectives, and then head for it.",2,2
18,107,"A former first year here and just failed physics. well, more like no record, but it feels a bit frustrating. I'm a bit worried on how much it will affect me in the future, and I don't even know how I would deal with this if someone were to point it out. 

Don't get me wrong, I think failing is a great learning opportunity, but somehow, failing a class hurts my self-esteem, especially when everyone I know is brilliant and amazing while I feel like I'm so far behind them. 

Maybe I'm overreacting about failing my first class, but I had hope that I would be able to pass the class and not have to worry about it anymore. I only took 48 units worth of classes this semester, but I would say one of my other classes steals a lot of time from physics, and as a result, I didn't put a lot of time studying for the quizzes. 

Didn't know it was gonna go down hill so fast right after drop date. Sorry if this is not the best place to vent or I'm ruining the end of the year vibes for most people, but I just wanted get rid of this awful feeling before it gets the best of me next semester. 

Cheers for another year done for those coming back in the fall and congrats to the graduating seniors!",3,3
19,1072,"My passion was always to find a way to make a difference. But it wasn't until later in life that I really understood how to channel that passion. Right out of high school, I was being recruited to play football at Pittsburgh college and the first day of class, I didn't go. Because I couldn't figure out how I was gonna get from where I live to Pittsburgh College which was at least 45 minutes away. There was nobody around me to really help me understand the value of what that university could provide me. So I just turned it down. 

I didn't understand where I was going or how I was gonna get there. But I went, walked into the doors of a community college and then the community college pulled me in. Now, I have the privilege of serving as the chancellor for the California Community Colleges. So I have the pleasure of representing more than 2.1 million students to have the opportunity to finish a quality college credential and get into a job, or to transfer and something that gives them an opportunity to really achieve what they wanna achieve. 

But that's what it did for me and that's given me the opportunity to really fulfill my passion and take it from there.",2,2
20,1073,"I'm the Vice President at Ascend Insurance Brokerage and we work directly with the entertainment industry. We work with music venues, music festivals, touring artists, event safety, event security companies. I got into this industry by accident. I was playing in a band and we were touring the country, having a lot of fun, and not really thinking about insurance, to be quite honest. 

My broker said no one knows this industry like you, come to work for me, and I just found out I was really good at it. It's cool because I'll talk to people and I'll tell them what I do and most commonly people are like, I didn't even know you could get insurance for that. 

I think the beauty of the industry is that the insurance is everywhere. It doesn't just stop with home, auto, life. If you're into extreme sports, I know a brokerage in California that focuses on extreme sports. If you're into hunting and fishing, I know underwriters that specialize in that industry. 

Get an idea of what's out there. If you're sitting there going I'm not quite sure what I wanna do in this industry, that's okay. There's a lot of opportunity in this industry so feel around.",1,1
21,1081,"I have a very gradual retinitis pigmentosa, real gradual degeneration of the retina. So I went through all the phases of low vision and now to just about total, total blindness. 

It started to become an issue when I was 21 and was diagnosed with this disability. And then, I was aware of what my future was going to be like, that I was gonna be going blind. 

So having a disability is like playing a puzzle. If you like puzzles, boy, having a disability is great, because you are always trying to figure out how to do something, how to make it work, how to find technology that works. You gotta make it work for you, and I think it's very important for everybody to say, hey, I got a disability and get to work on having a great life. 

That's absolutely essential, and I see a lot of people that do not accept their disability. They're waiting for a cure or something like this, and the wonderful advances in medicine. That's great, but you can't build a life around hoping for something to come and cure you. You just have to figure out ways of making things work.",3,3

I come back and I'm 30, I'm broke, I'm living in my mother-in-law's house, my wife's grieving. It's just not a good time. 

I realize it's time, I need to do something I want to do for the rest of my life. I see an ad in the Sunday Chronicle, for the assistant to the publisher at Mother Jones Magazine. I was just like, ""That would be the job for me. That is a place where I can see myself. That's the right fit for me.'' 

Just through a combination of luck and good timing and working hard and being the right guy at the right time, I worked my way up the editorial side to the managing end.

23,1092,"I was born in Lima, Peru, and I came to the US when I was 5 years old. I remember being a kid, and seeing my aunt and my grandmother clean homes. They all cleaned different homes. And sometimes they'd clean these beautiful homes. You'd always think wow, I wish I could live in a home like this. And so seeing them work so hard I think instilled a kind of good work ethic in me. 

I became a US citizen at 21. It gave me a huge sense of love of country and love of this country, and I knew then that I wanted to do more to give back. I'm the youngest mayor of any big city in the US. And having to deal with the fact, I was trying to prove myself because of my age, that I can do this job, and yes, I'm gay, that provides some challenges. 

But for me, the part that defines me the most, besides being young or being gay, is being an immigrant, because immigrants don't have easy lives here. And I think sometimes there's a lot of conversation about immigrants and their contributions to this country, and I think the contributions are incredible. 

Here I am 15, 20 years later, I'm a mayor of a big city. That's an immigrant that got a chance, and there's so many other immigrants out there that want the same chances.",2,2
24,1098,"So I'm a highschool drop out. Teenage life got really tough, like the family started having problems. So I learned from a young age about money, how it can really mess things up. But it just got to the point where I needed to find my own happiness so when I was 17, I ran away from home, moved to the mountains, and got a job as a lift operator. 

Everything fell apart, I ended up living in a tent in the woods, in the snow. And I was just so dedicated to wanting to ride that I just stayed, went with it. So I was digging, I was a good digger and I wanted to ride. 

So the guy who had the first opportunity to build summer parks up there, he's like you're our best digger, do you wanna come and run the show next year? So within that one year, having that vision and that drive to do it, and that sacrifice of actually living in the mountains in the snow, it all worked out. 

Within two years I was working and writing for Volcom. I was getting paid to snowboard and I was building a snowboard park that was changing the sport. It happened fast.",3,3

I used to dream that maybe I can work at NASA one day. I had a picture of me standing on a room with a bunch of people sitting down and I was saying what we were going to do. That's my job today. 

The impact that I wanted to do in the world was not gonna be an impact that I was gonna do in five hours of work or in a day or in a month of work. It was gonna be an impact that I wanted people to sit down in school and read that textbook and say Curiosity Mars Rover discovered x, y, z, and then my name in there. 

And so you might have to actually sit down and think, what do I wanna do? Or who do I wanna be? That's gonna help you realize what excites you. Try to tie it down to your path and then your education and then just hold on to it.",2,2

How are you going to class, and you're thinking, okay, let me study for the CS test, but my mom's calling me because there's not enough food to eat, or my sister's calling me because they don't have supplies for school, or new clothes, or anything. 

So you're bringing all of those things with you. Finding people to be able to relate to that are advisors or councelors that you can talk to about those things, that understand you and can relate to you has really helped because they understand me, they get it, I'm validated. 

Now I can focus on taking this test, or studying for this exam, or doing whatever else you need to do.",3,3
27,1114,"I think I've always had that fire in my belly for impact. An exercise in a leadership course that I took helped kind of solidify this for me that you need to find your sweet spot. The way we define sweet spot is if look at like a Venn Diagram of three circles overlapping, one circle is what you're passionate about. The next circle is skills, what do you excel in? And then the third circle is your values. So where the three overlap, that's your sweet spot. 

So for me I loved the idea of events. I loved the idea of people coming together and learning and engaging and sharing. And then I realized I wanna figure out a way to impact the world around me. And so I decided in 2008 to go off and start a business. And we work with government agencies, cities, corporations, nonprofits, and large scale events on implementing sustainability plans. 

I love the impact and the work that we're able to do all over the world. And so I think it's really important to really embrace who you are and all of your decisions, so respect that. Respect your gut feeling. It's coming from somewhere. It's coming from inside , and I think it's important to really make sure that you're staying true to yourself and your own personal mission.",2,2
28,1118,"We took a really cool course that invited people who weren't engineers but who wanted to do some sort of science change. It was an art science class that said, it's all about combining the beauty of art and the analytical power of science to do something so you just had to come in and have an idea and then find a way to combine those two to come up with a solution. So we just locked ourselves up and brainstormed. And this is what we presented. And thankfully being at somewhere like Harvard there were a lot of resources that were made available to us. So from the class we got a small grant to keep on playing around with the idea. 

And for awhile it was just kind of trying to understand what is this ball. Engineers didn't believe it could work. So we actually had to research how it would work. Research the Faraday Principle. Then, build their own conceptual model, test it in South Africa and then have engineers say okay. 

For us it was really interesting, because people always say, how do you think out of the box? And I'm like, it's really easy to think out of the box when you don't even know the parameters of the box. If you don't even know that a box exists, whereas knowledge is power. Sometimes with knowledge it's very easy to see the obstacles. And we were just like, why wouldn't it work? 

Even though we did not necessarily have the technical expertise, we certainly knew the context.",1,1
29,1120,"I started my career in law as a paralegal. So I thought I was gonna be a lawyer and then I kinda never met a happy lawyer. Coming from that environment, I went into film and TV. I knew all these guys that were selling TV shows, market by market, which was known as a syndicator. It is sales, it is pitching, it is being able to speak, I was like, wow that's a great job, I wanna do that. 

So at that point I convinced some investors to take a chance on something really different. I felt there was a real void in terms of translating video games to proper entertainment. And as I went on my journey to focus on providing an independent, go to source for Esports and competitive gaming, I thought we can really build the news unlike any other. And so I created Gamer World News and it's growing today. 

I had a long career in TV and TV syndication and all that, and that switched. And I wouldn't have thought I'd be on national news as a contributor, that wasn't my path. But that led me to do it. So push yourself to do things that are a little outside your comfort zone, that you actually don't think you're qualified for.",2,2
30,1121,"My father married my stepmother and I didn't know that that was my stepmom, because they got married when I was 2. She abused me, her brothers abused me. And I had a lot of law enforcement contact when I was a kid. 

I remember the cops saying, we can't help you. We know you're lying, but we can't help you until you say something. So that just really resonated with me, and I always wanted to be a cop. So I've been a cop for 18 years now. 

I remember when I was going through the academy and people are yelling you and they're throwing things, I would see my stepmother's face and that would get me through that. When I had this huge tact staff officer and I was staring at his chest and he was yelling at me, I'm like Dude, that's all you got? I've had the worse happen to me, bring it. 

You gotta dig deep. And remember, whatever feeds you, mine was anger towards my mom, and I wanted to prove her wrong. You gotta find what that thing that gives you a fire inside and just focus on it, and it's a daily thing of working on it.",3,3
31,1134,"My first few years of college, I took a computer programming class, I took a bio-medical engineering class, never really took a great liking to them. I had been working in the restaurants and I realized that's something I enjoyed. I had taken a job out of college with a restaurant company and I've been working for them for about a year and half. It was a good learning tool, but sometimes I felt like I was getting beat up. 

So, my brother, he was about to finish school here, in San Marcos. And he was calling me and saying, hey, let's do something on our own. It just kind of came to a head for me and I put in the two weeks on my job and I moved back here and there was a gentleman operating a pizzeria in this space. He literally just closed the doors one day. 

So, we took over the space and that's how we got in the pizza business. We weren't really expecting to. Sometimes you have to make a decision about doing something you don't know the outcome, and it's very risky. In some form or fashion, you're kind of crossing your fingers that it's going to work out.",2,2
32,114,"When I got here as a freshman I had no social skills whatsoever. My parents pretty much locked me up with videos games a kid. Their reasoning was if I was around other kids they would get me hooked on drugs. Had my parents actually done any research on drug addiction they would have learned that social lives generally help people stay sober. 

So when I got here I couldn't hold a basic conversation with most people unless it was about schoolwork. I remember spending every night crying alone in the shower so my roommate wouldn't hear because I didn't know how to express myself or relate to him. Most people thought I was a lunatic or autistic, or some interesting combination of both. 

I slowly observed and learned how to do social skills with other people. My first two years here was a long painful series of poor interactions. I remember wanting to shout when people gave me odd looks, ""I'm trying to learn how to talk to you, I'm 10 years behind and I have to catch up, can you cut me some slack?!?!"" 

I slowly got better, made friends and even have a girlfriend now. They all actually make a point to help me be aware. So I want to let everyone else out there feeling like they can't learn to be normal with people, you can do it. It's going to hurt and be scary, but I promise with work and determination it gets better.",3,3
33,1140,"When I was 18, I left for the Navy and joined the military and went in to learn signals analysis and not computer stuff. When I was in college, I tried a second time to get out of computers. I was the first one in my family to go so I really didn't have any experience. 

I went for an art degree and I realized I'm horrible at this. I can't draw. I think I got an assignment that said, describe or write a report on some classical architecture. I got a D on it, and I was like what happened? You're meant to explain how it made you feel. And I was like this isn't for me. 

So the next week I changed over to programming instead. I kind of stumbled into malware analysis because that was one of the classes they offered while I was in the Navy. I took that, and I said this is awesome, this is great, I love doing this stuff. 

From there I learned how to reverse engineer and did that for a few years. I worked as a contractor after I got out of the Navy and then I got in with Malwarebytes. We do all kinds of stuff from research and analysis to presenting. 

So that's how I'm where I'm at right now.",1,1
34,1143,"We are creating soft multi-layered forms that interact with environments. And create a space in cities that open up our imagination and allow us to think about a different way of being. 

So I had $300 and for graduation I got a plane ticket to Bali. And I went off on my own and started walking through the rice fields until I found a little house to rent. I went as a painter, I shipped all my paints and they got lost, and that is how I became a sculptor, because I had no paint. 

I was in a fishing village, they had fishing twine, and began just experimenting, and from there I had this dream of bringing it back home. I applied to seven art schools and I was rejected by all seven. And that turned out to be the luckiest thing ever in my life, because it forced me to have to learn how to teach myself. 

The education to do what I do, there is no program. If I had gone to a program, it might have led me somewhere, but it wouldn't have been as authentic a direction. Any kind of life where you're trying to do something new, and creative, you're gonna hit rejections all the time. 

My mom had a saying for that too, it's like just toughen up, let it come at me. Just because you're rejecting me from every single art school I've applied to, that doesn't mean you get to say that I'm not an artist. 

The thing I had to teach myself after college, was how to hear my own voice, like honestly I just didn't even know it to recognize it. Making decisions is gonna happen to you your whole life, they are always hard, you've got to figure out how to make them. And you have to listen to yourself and get to know yourself.",2,2
35,115,"The memorable event was my birthday which took place last month (September).I am one of those who prefer to remain in silence and celebrate occasions with a few close ones, but this particular one, I got a surprise birthday party from my siblings and boyfriend. I wasn't in anyway aware, It was a great celebration and one I can't easily forget. There were plenty of drinks,foods and cake chocolates and loads of blessings, wishes and prayers from friends and family. 

My friends came over,most of them with different beautiful gifts, some with drinks. I got a beautiful black dress as a gift from my boyfriend, I changed into it, had some makeup on, jewelry, and a beautiful diamond shoe. We took plenty of beautiful pictures, danced, games, we really had fun. Its been a really long time I had a party, I was glad to be surprised with this particular one. 

I got a big frame of myself from my siblings and also a diamond ring from my partner. My boyfriend proposed to me with the diamond ring that very night, OMG!.My joy knew no bound, we partied all night. I was grateful having such great and beautiful people around to celebrate me. 

The event is so fresh in my heart. The decoration was colorful and beautifully arranged in the colours I love so much. I will be glad to have more birthday parties in subsequent years. My engagement will probably be the next great event I will be witnessing soon. Having people around you is a real deal.",3,3

It's a huge deal to me to be in this community that still has a lot of racism and stereotypes. The drunk Indian, or being lazy, or we don't speak good English. It was huge to succeed in that world, but the way I got into the river community, somebody invited me a trip. 

And I said, oh I don't know if I should do it, it's in the middle of school. I was in grad school, just started my grad work, but I've never been on a boat in my life before then. I've never been in the Grand Canyon, down in the canyon itself, never. 

But deep down inside, you get that gut feeling like I'm not sure if I should do this. But something's telling you, go for it. There's a lot of firsts for me, I'm very proud of that. 

I think my role is to tell people that anything is possible. Take advantage of every opportunity that you can, that may be presented to you, or you may see it from afar and say, I'm gonna go get that. I'm gonna do it.",3,3
37,116,"I went on a very memorable trip to Crater Lake Oregon on July 8th. It was particularly special because it was me and my girlfriend's 1 year anniversary. We stayed at the Crater Lake Lodge which is normally a very hard venue to reserve. However, my girlfriend was very prompt and smart about reserving the space very early on which allowed us to stay at the lodge. 

To our surprise we noticed there was snow amid the hot sun. The crater lake had an unforgettable view and it was breathtaking. It is so hard to describe the emotions that we both felt. During the whole day we drank a lot of wine to keep ourselves warm and with the slight booze it kept us rather excited throughout the day. We went on a couple of hikes throughout the day. 

One thing that was in our bucket list was to jump into the lake but that never ended up happening. This was because the roads were closed because there were some cracks and boulders that needed to be removed. 

In the evening the lodge was very cozy. However, with such a beautiful view of the sky we ended up chit chatting until 3AM. Our next day was planned to go to Portland and yes we were exhausted but we didn’t really mind. 

This trip really got us thinking about developing our relationship and thus it was truly unforgettable for both of us. I hope to go again on another time and stay at the lounge with the lake view. That was the only downside because it was hard to reserve a spot and we had to stay in the mountain view. 

All in all I hope to revisit my memory in the future.",2,2
38,117,"I had been miserable for quite some time with no answers from any of the doctors I had seen. Finally went to see a knowledgeable ENT doctor who is an understanding, kind person and was told my nose was filled with polyps and terribly deviated septum. I went through the process and had surgery done. The first few days after were rather terrible, lots of pain, sinuses packed and stents put in to prevent swelling and allow drainage. 

My mother took care of myself and my small child so my husband could still work, we wouldn't have been able to make it through without her and I'm eternally grateful. I went back for the first follow up appointment and he removed the packing and stuck a light and suction tube in my sinuses and sucked out gobs and gobs of congealed blood. 

Although it was completely gross to watch and not the greatest feeling, afterwards I felt air in places in my sinuses that I'm not sure I've ever felt. Even though I was blowing out blood and gunk for the next week and still taking pain pills since Doc had broken and set my septum, I'd never felt so light and happy. 

I did take a lot of vitamin C throughout this time frame and Doc was impressed with how quickly I healed up from fairly invasive surgery. Most people take breathing through the nose for granted. Imagine what it feels like to have a sinus infection and then to feel like that for years and multiple doctors just handing out antibiotics and steroids. At one point I was even prescribed antidepressants because he thought it was all in my head. 

It has been a very frustrating journey through the 'healthcare system'.Its been almost 6 months now and I continue to be hopeful that I can keep the polyps from coming back as science today doesn't seem to know why they form. 

Unfortunately, it really is up to me to figure out how my body works, what it needs to operate appropriately and perhaps find an Orthomolecular Doctor who can help me do so and treat me in a holistic fashion. Insurance companies don't like these kinds of Doctors and don't usually cover much, I suppose if you heal yourself and prevent problems they don't make much money. The irony.",3,3
39,1177,"Because of where I grew up, the Jewish suburbs of Baltimore, you were expected to prepare yourself to go to medical school. So my parents had pretty much figured in their heads that I would become a doctor. It just seemed like, ""Well, what else would I do?'' Like that's what people did if they were smart. They become a doctor. 

And so I got a summer internship after my freshman year in college at the University of Maryland hospital in the shock-trauma unit. And that same summer, I went around just looking for anything in radio or television or advertising. And I ended up at NPR that summer. 

It's not a satisfying answer to hear, ""Just get in there and try it, and you will have a feeling one way or another."" But in fact, it's the only really honest answer that anybody would give you, who's done it. You just have to run at something until something is talking to your heart loudly enough that you won't even have to wonder if it's the right thing. 

But you have to run pretty hard. And you have to be a moron along the way, and you have to accept that there's going to be a lot of wasted time and energy and that that's not a bad thing.",2,2
40,1178,"The first music I ever listened to was house music. You don't really know what you wanna do until you stumble on it. I always knew I loved music from a young age, but I never thought it was a thing that I could pursue seriously. When I applied to college, my dad is like, you can do whatever you want as long as it makes you happy. And I was like okay, can I do music? And he was like, no. So I got in as computer science. 

Once I got my first programming job, it was enough money for me to basically be completely financially independent, so I moved out and just started just doing my own thing. Even while I was working my job, I would just work in the day, and then work all night, and barely sleep, because I knew I just wanted to get good at making music. So I just burned both ends of the candle for years. 

You can just never give up on what you want to do, because you have one life to live, and once chance to do what you want to do. So you have to do it no matter what anyone says.",2,2
41,1182,"A few years ago I had a bit of a scare. My appendix ruptured on tour and I came close to dying. And it was the same week that my first song went into the top 20. After more than 20 years of making music, we had a song, Say Hey I Love You. And I'm on this gurney being wheeled down to perhaps my death. 

And I get this text. Your song's in the top 20, and I'm like, it didn't even matter. I was like, whatever. I was like, I just wanna see my kids again. I wanna be with my family. And I can appreciate having made music for that long that it's a nice thing to have a lot of people hear your song. But if I can't share with my family, it doesn't matter. 

At this point in my life, I'm 48. I have two sons. I have one who's 27 and I have one who's 15. And I still feel like I'm 22 years old. I still have the same passion for what I do with music. And I have this life that I feel is fulfilling in so many ways that I feel happy most of the time.",3,3

Or here's the blue pill, you can take the blue pill and it will just put you to sleep. It's not gonna challenge you in this world.

So we did it, and sure enough 400 people showed up and we actually made money. And were were just like, this is amazing. 

So a lot of my time from then to now has just been that. Has just been thinking about things that I really wanted to do or see, and kind of trusting that there are other people out there who are thinking the exact same thing as I am. Helvetica is a perfect example, the movie. I just wanted to watch a movie about graphic design and fonts. Just because I was kind of a design geek, and I couldn't find anything out there.

It took us about a week to find something nice and affordable in our area, so we bounced around hotels for that time and treated it like a bit of a vacation and a getting used to living with each other experience. We found a place we liked though and moved the very next day. 

It was a bit of a leap from how things used to be, but I'm glad I took the leap. It was definitely time in my life to try this out as I'm already 25 now. Heck, most of my friends are getting married now so I feel almost like an oddball. It's ok though because I'm happier going at my own pace. 

I'd say this has been a good choice though. I believe it will only bring my partner and I closer than we ever have been before. We're like our own team and can stand up to any of life's challenges. It's nice to be part of something like that.

And the big breakthrough was we built a music video for OK Go, and that job kind of led to this job. So these are a bunch of different, carnival midway games but they all have modern twists on them. We use a lot of projectors, we use a lot of cameras and code, and all this other stuff and we're making new games for our micro-amusement parks that we're putting into Los Angeles. 

When we started on this journey of building crazy stuff for a living, I don't think we were trying to build any sort of empire. We took so many wrong turns, you should have seen how many dumb ideas we did. They just never panned out and we just wasted time and money on it. 

But we all want something that we can do with our lives that we feel good about and pays the bills.",1,1

I really wanted to be with people, I wanted to be a social being. And I wanted to see more smiles, make a difference in someone's life, and touch someone's life on an everyday basis. 

And when I did my externship in different places, I really enjoyed pediatrics. I was fortunate to work with autistic kids and kids who have seizures and other medical problems. And it was really touching for me to see how much the parents go through to have one autistic child, how much they see, and the patience that they have. 

At the end of the day, what pays off is your satisfaction. If you're happy in what you're doing, no matter how much sacrifices it takes, no matter how much effort it takes.

He was my only brother and I miss him more than words can really describe. It has been really tough on my mom and dad and it is for them that I try to stay strong. He was 18 years old at the time of his death, which is just sad considering he had just celebrated his birthday the month before he died. 

Life can be really unfair sometimes and at other times it can be even worse. People keep telling me that it will get easier, but I find that hard to believe. 

He was a prodigy at guitar and skateboarding. Those were my two major obsessions and the moment I gave him a taste of each he easily outpaced me in both in no time at all. He had even been sponsored by a skate shop and got all of his skateboard stuff for free just for using it.

I learned shortly thereafter that he actually couldn't afford to go to high school. You just take a lot of things for granted like I took the fact that I could go to school for granted, that I could go to college for granted. That's what made this experience of meeting John so shocking to me. 

From there I was inspired to create the School Fund, which is a nonprofit that connects people with students in the developing world that just need a bit of money to continue their education. One of the things I think is really awesome about being a young person is, we don't always see all the roadblocks other adults might see. I saw this kid John and I was like, wow this is a big problem, let's do something about it. 

I didn't necessarily see all the road blocks of, oh we have to register as a non profit. We just threw it out there and got going with something.

The professor also teaches an animation class, maybe you should do it. We started doing these little graphic projects, and I was really interested in them. 

And then I was like wow , there's so much I can do with this, and there's so many intersections between film and the film world and technology. I knew I wanted to work in a space that kind of intertwined both of those spaces, and then two years after graduation, I'm here at YouTube doing engineering. 

I build the YouTube app for emerging markets which is YouTube Go. We're building for spaces where data is both slow and expensive. And so this is essentially to give access to YouTube and everything that it provides to these different communities.

When I got out of the hospital, it colored every single bit of my life because I couldn't get insurance. They wouldn't let me play sports, they wouldn't let me in the military. So it was a downer. 

In other ways, I just looked at it like no, I will achieve. The thing that I always share with people is think about your own thing, what it is you love and a way to make it into a life. 

I just think there's lots of people who don't ever really achieve, they sort of surrender. And I've been at that place too, where you surrender. You don't do what you're passionate about. 

And then 20 years from now you're like man, I didn't do what I really loved. For me it's always thinking about, how can you do something that you really love doing as a business?

I went over in mind about maybe backing out, maybe only sticking with the few friends there I already knew very well, but eventually I settled on just sucking it up and going on my own. When I got there, I instantly felt somewhat out of place because I only knew a few faces, but that did not deter me from having my mind set on having a good time. 

I threw myself out there in some games, got talking to a lot of new people, and ended up making a lot of new friends throughout the night. As it went on, I felt less and less shy and nervous about trying to make a good impression. I began to be able to break out of my shell and act like myself, and I am so glad I did. 

The whole party was an absolute blast and I made a lot of friends, many of whom I will be contacting in the future with more plans to hang out. This party was a big step for me. It has been awhile since I have been able to put myself out there and try to meet new people. 

I was nervous about whether or not these new friends would be receptive to my personality or if I would come off as the weird awkward dude in the corner. My good friends who were there even commented on how they were impressed with how social I was being with total strangers. That might have been helped by the few beers I had, but that liquid courage got me past the first few hurdles I needed help with. 

I need to just be more confident in myself as a person, and the people around me will start to see me in a better light.",2,2
53,1217,"So I grew up in the projects in Canarsie. Similar, I think, to the environments a lot of you might be used to, gun violence, gangs. I grew up on welfare for the first 17 years of my life. You have to find motivation to succeed every possible place you can. Even if it's a negative emotion. 

When you start thinking about the negativity, about the stupid decisions you made, about the people who made you feel bad, turn that into fuel. Transmute your frustration into the fuel. 

There is this avatar or this person that says, you know, you just like your mom. Your mom did nothing, you going be nothing, that's you. And you go I can't wait to prove this person, like, it is going to mean so much to me when that person eats every single word and they have no idea how great I am, how much I give back, how much I help others, how positive my life is. 

So I'm not trying to become great to then hurt this person. I'm not trying to become great to hurt someone. I'm trying to become great and I'm trying to find every possible tool to keep me moving forward because it's so easy to want to quit.",3,3
54,1219,"I run this conglomerate of franchise businesses and food brands. Focus Brands is basically a developer of global multichannel food brands. We grow through acquisition. We don't start businesses, we buy them, make them multichannel and stronger franchise businesses, and then grow them. 

I went back and got my MBA at Georgia State, so I have a master's without a bachelor's. It's unusual but possible. I was almost always the only woman, almost always younger by 30 years. 

I also learned that, even though I was different in whatever ways, you've got your own set of differences that you bring to the table. I was younger, I was one of the only females, I certainly didn't have a polished background. At that point, I wasn't a college graduate. 

I didn't let that set of differences become so fear-feeding that it became an anchor. They were my truths, they are my roots, but they're not an anchor. I was proud of the way I handled difficult scenarios, so I knew I would continue to run things. 

But even then I didn't say I want to be a president by this age. My motivator was learning and growing, some of it coming from my difficult background. For me, success was about being somewhere different tomorrow than I am today.",2,2
55,122,"I had a memorable event that has stuck with me when I was given the opportunity to buy my dream car. I have always driven a full size pick-up truck and due to my commute to work decided that it was time to downsize and buy a more compact car. I have long wanted a 4 door Audi A3. The style and overall design really attracted me to the the Audi line. With a strong financial income and little to no debt I thought that it was time for me to make my dream purchase. 

I went to my local Audi dealership two weeks before vacation with high hopes of driving away in my dream car. Two dealerships later and a whole lot of negotiating I was given the deal that worked for me and was able to drive away in my brand new Audi A3. It was a cold April night when I finally completed signing my life away and was handed over the keys to my new car. I will never forget the smell of that black and grey leather interior. Also, the feeling of the heated leather seats! 

Due to the weather that night and how late it was I decided to head home and wait until the next day to go for a nice long ride. I left my house the following day after admiring the exterior of the car and how good it looked parked in front of my house and headed straight for the beach. I know, surprising right? Heading to the beach on a cold April day? Yes! 

To this day I enjoy my rides to work just a little bit more each day thanks to my beautiful Audi A3. The added bonus is the gas mileage that I get with this car! I would highly recommend this compact sporty vehicle to anyone in the market. 

Thank you Audi; you have earned yourself a lifelong customer! This was the most positive memorable event that has happened to me over the last few months!",2,2
56,1226,"Since I was little I received unwanted attention from many people, from little things, such as some guy showed me his penis before I was 10, to something worse. But there was one particular guy, who would kiss me against my will on many occasions. The first time it happened, I was 12 and I got angry and punched him in the face. Everyone around me said that I overreacted and really nothing was wrong, so since then I never cared when someone kissed me or touched me when I didn't want to. 

Since then I got angry one more time: when I was 14, one guy, whom I was really close with and trusted a lot, held me down for another guy because it was just a game or at least started as a truth or dare. 

This past summer a guy got me drunk to have sex with me. He was holding me down on a bed with the weight of his body, and as I was resisting and asking him to stop, he was just laughing and telling me that I wanted it. The following day I hung out with him and another old high school friends like nothing happened, I guess I became insensitive to whatever people would do to me. 

After coming to college, I for the first time in my life realized that what has been happening before was not the way things are supposed to be. It was the first time here when I learned what word ""consent"" meant. I'm not saying that nothing unwanted can happen to you here, but I'm saying that there are many nice people, whom you can trust, and you can have very positive experiences.",3,3
57,1228,"After having a pretty rough night where I constantly felt like I was on the verge of passing out, I went to bed and got around two hours of sleep. When I woke up, I felt completely sobered up, but the life circumstances that made me drink so much in the first place kept me awake for the next hour and a half, thinking and thinking. It's so hard to get away from your thoughts sometimes. 

Even though I really felt like I should sleep, I just couldn't, so I ended up getting out of bed, taking a cold shower, and heading on campus at six in the morning. Watching the sun rise on a new day as I made my way toward campus, I felt incredibly at peace despite the chaos that is my life right now. That feeling made me want to cry. 

I wish I could get up everyday early in the morning, feeling motivated to overcome anything that happens to me, but instead there are always days where I stay in bed until my roommate comes back from class, days where I sit in front of my computer with something to do but unable to bring myself to do it, days where I think giving up would be so much easier than fighting. I can't help but notice that most of my days are like that. 

But today is different. Today will be a good day, and I can't say the same for tomorrow or tomorrow's tomorrow or days, weeks, months, and years after that, but knowing that another day will come along where I wake up feeling like things are getting better makes me hope. It makes me hope that someday the balance will change, that I will be happy more often than I am sad, that my thoughts will let me go and let me live, that every difficult experience I have is moving me forward, not holding me back. 

I don’t know that any of this is relatable, and I can’t say that my situation is resolved after today, but I can’t help but marvel at the wonder that is hope. Having hope that things will be better and that life will go on, even when it feels impossible, has given me the strength to take this day in my hands and to make it what I want it to be. This hope will keep me walking on days when I feel like falling, and this hope tells me that no matter how hard it is today, no matter how much I hurt, no matter how unfathomable it is to continue, I will.",3,3
58,123,"My uncle passed away last week. I've never known anyone who passed away that I was this close to in my life, and his was the first funeral I've ever attended. Last Friday I attended his visitation at a funeral home with all our close friends and family. I walked in thinking I could be strong and hold it together and thought I had certainly cried enough tears by then. But as soon as I saw my cousins (his children) and my aunt (his wife), I lost all composure and cried with them. 

While I had been mourning his loss, so much of my sadness was centered on his immediate family and I couldn't help but wonder how empty and sad they were feeling over this loss. Many people spoke at the funeral home, telling stories, many of which were funny because he was a very funny man, and it was a relief to remember those positive times when he would shine in his humor, which was such a gift to all of us. But there were sad points, too. 

Watching relatives find the courage to volunteer to speak about him and his life, then watching them break down trying to speak. They simply couldn't catch their breath. And then the next day was his actual funeral. 

The church ceremony was emotional, but the priest, a relative, did his very best to comfort us with words. It was a tough time, but it brought us all together to remember a man who loved us all so much. He will never be forgotten. The pain will always be there, but so will his love and legacy.",3,3
59,1232,"During my orientation week, I heard a peer say they didn't know what DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) was and they didn't need to care about it. Fast forward five years, I spent a lot of my time on DEI initiatives, mainly because I was unhappy with the situations I and others were facing. 

And that confession that said they were skeptical of students being more interested in activism than research, just shows how easy it is for some students to look the other way. 

I spent years on DEI initiatives that are flaky at best because my department only half commits, and not even gonna mention admin shenanigans. I felt this was so important that my research progress struggled, that I had to drop projects and switch directions. 

I spent so much unrecognized time on DEI, and unfortunately it robbed time away from what I actually came here to do, but the working conditions here really merited the honest time I put into it. 

Some of us have no choice but to care because it impacts us, some of us have no choice but to be activists because otherwise we can't make it through the institute to do what we came here for. Some of us have no option but to care about our activism. 

My hope is the next generations don't have to go through this struggle.",2,2
60,1234,"I switched academic advisors today. When I emailed my new advisor, I made a joke about my bad GPA, because my old advisor gave me shit for getting bad grades. (""Anon, maybe you're just not smart enough to be here."") My old advisor didn't want to have me because I made her look bad. My new advisor replied that he's honestly excited to get to know me better. He said he was going to work with me to figure out how to survive college. He didn't care that my GPA is bad. 

This unexpected support and acceptance made me sit down and sob for the first time in months. I didn't know why I was crying at first, but then I realized it was just the relief that someone was finally NOT judging me for my grades. Everyone who has seen my academic record just assumes things about me, because after all, how can you get D's and still deserve to be here? 

I realized that this is the first time in two years that I've felt like more than the sum of my GPA and academic achievements. That's how I know this is such a fucked up place. Somehow, the faculty and staff have lost humanity amidst problem sets and exams and grades. I even forgot that I'm more than a sum of my academic achievements. It's easy to say to each other ""oh, you are more than your grades,"" but when your professors and advisor and faculty and mentors don't echo the same message, that's when things get bad. 

Thank God for this professor. To anyone else out there who feels like they're absolute shit because their academic record isn't perfect, you are SO MUCH MORE than grades and problem sets and exams and school. You are a complex, beautiful, amazing human being and you deserve to be treated that way. Please don't forget it.",3,3
61,1237,"Recently I took a trip with my partner, Karl, to an amusement park about an hour east called Kentucky Kingdom. We don't have a ton of money to spend on vacation, so any little trip is a big deal for us. Also we totally suck at planning things, and hadn't done anything all summer, until we really buckled down and started making a cohesive plan. We splurged and got a hotel near the park for two nights, and invited a friend of ours from Tennessee to come stay with us too. His name was Nick, and we'd never met him. 

That is to say, we met him on Twitch. Karl and I started streaming a little over a year ago, and while I got bored of it fairly quickly, he kept at it and ended up starting a small group of streamers. Nick was one of the first members added to the group, all of us fans of the game Dropmix (a strange music/card game hybrid). In the months that followed we would all become closer watching each others stream at different times of the day, keeping each other company at work and so on. So when we invited him to stay with us, we felt like we knew him. 

I would describe myself as having a high degree of social anxiety. I had some hesitation about meeting someone in real life who only knew me from my online persona. But it ended up being awesome! Karl, Nick, and myself all share a love of roller coasters in addition to weird card games, and surprisingly none of us had ever been to Kentucky Kingdom before. 

The lines were short and they offered free soda to visitors from out of town (I won't say no!), the rides were awesome, and the people-watching was on point. The only drawback to the whole thing was that Nick and Karl both snore. But I'd had enough to drink each night that it wasn't much of an issue. 

I ended up feeling glad that we rallied and planned a trip, however quaint. It's something more people should try. Even just a few days away with friends made the stressful reality of day to day life a little more tolerable.",2,2
62,1238,"On July 20th, 2019, I got married! After all of the planning and waiting, it was wonderful. It was hot, but everything except pictures was indoors, so it wasn't too bad. We had a ceremony in the LDS temple in Logan, Utah. It was perfect. There are people who I wish had been able to attend, but I was still able to see many friends and family who I hadn't for some time. 

When my husband and I walked out of the temple, everyone was there to greet us and take pictures and give hugs. My husband looked perfect in his charcoal grey tux, and we couldn't stop smiling the whole time. We hired a photographer to take pictures, but my grandpa's a photographer too, so he buzzed around and took a lot of photos too. 

We had a reception afterwards in the Riverwoods conference center. Our reception hall turned out really beautiful, and our parents said the sweetest things. I got to meet one of my husband's sisters for the first time. A couple who my family knew when we lived in Dubai several years ago even came! Some other friends from overseas were able to attend as well, so I was really great to see them again. 

Everything went really smoothly, and I think everyone had a wonderful time.",2,2
63,1239,"I recently was involved in a short relationship with a wonderful man. We hit it off well and got close quickly, but it soon became very clear that he doesn't have any time for me in his life. I talked to him about how I was feeling and he tried to understand and do what he could, but ultimately there was just no way forward. 

After barely hearing from him for a couple days, I messaged him to tell him that I wanted to make it work and I tried, but it was clear that it wasn't possible and I couldn't be his girlfriend. He agreed that there was nothing he could do to change his situation and how it related to me and our potential together and that it made sense to end it. 

Although I wasn't expecting anything different, it hurt a lot that I could see he hadn't actually put any effort in, other than deciding to tell me he loves me, and that he so easily let go of the possibility of having any future. He was the one who insisted we try to be together, despite the obvious challenges. 

I feel even more like he doesn't care about my feelings or find them valid, because I told him I was concerned we weren't on the same page since the very beginning, and he insisted we were. I cried in the bathroom at work until I could finally pull myself back together. 

Meanwhile, he decided that the idea that we would be friends instead should start right away and sent me several messages complaining about his job. I had to tell him that I'm sorry he's frustrated at work and I care for him, it seemed really tone deaf at the moment and that I needed a beat before I could swoop into the role of providing him with emotional labor while getting nothing in return. I didn't say it in those words, but that's how I felt and it's just a new level of pain, because did he actually ever care, or did he just like someone caring about him? 

I feel like this is just another example of the fact that I will never meet anyone and I will spend the rest of my life alone. This was the best anything I've found in three years, I don't feel good about the future.",3,3
64,124,"I recently had a few different drastically life changing events take place. One of which is the beginning of a divorce. After ten years of marriage, my husband decided he wanted a divorce. After some of the awful things he did in our marriage, I was still hanging in hoping we could move past all the hurt and betrayal. But unfortunately, he got fed up with the process and decided to end it. 

Just within the last three months I have agreed to give him the divorce, had him lash out at me in unspeakable ways, been forced to move due to lack of ability to continue paying for the previous place and had to pick up the pieces for myself and my three young children. 

I thank God that he has given me several people in my life that have been there for me and helped me through all of this. Without them, it would have been way worse. 

I am still trying to get through this divorce, but I have faith that the Lord will work all this for good. Many other changes have come along with this divorce. Of course the move. The change in family dynamic, which has been the worst and most difficult change. The financial changes. The emotional changes in me, which I struggle with every single day. The coping of my children. 

Yes, this has been quite the emotional roller coaster. I am still looking to the Lord for daily strength.",3,3
65,1240,"I came home to a great surprise. My husband, family and close friends were in my backyard with the scent of ribs rushing to my nostrils. Everyone shouted surprise, hugs and kisses came towards me one after the other. 

I had just graduated and recieved my masters degree in criminology. I did not recieve a party when I got my bachelors so I really was not expecting one now. My parents with tears of joy mentioned how long they have been planning the party and how hard it was to keep my husband from letting out the secret. My husband while laughing mentioned how it was the hardest thing to do because i am always being noisy. 

They prepared all my favorite foods; jerked chicken, ribs, curried mutton, hotdogs fries and cheesecake. They had the right playlist and decors in my favorite colors. 

In the center of the yard was a table with gift boxes and cards. I was overwhelmed and still in disbelief as i have never had something like this, so much joy and pride in one place at the same time. Eveyone was talking and laughing, kids running around the yard. 

I grabbed my plate and feasted upon the food they had prepared. I ate, drank and danced and at the end of the night we played games and i opened my gifts. I received gift cards for my favorite restuarants, cash, jewelry and the greatest of all a new car from my husband, I could not hold back the tears as it burst from my eyes. 

This was definitely one of the most memorable moments of my life.",3,3
66,1241,"Six months ago I graduated from college. This moment was memorable because I was finally closing a chapter in my life that had taken so much of my time. I remember getting ready that day. I woke up early because I wanted to do my hair and makeup. I wanted to have the time to make it perfect. But, I quickly realized not everything was going to turn out perfect when my hair would just not curl. 

The time was already to go and I didn't have my dress on or my makeup up done. As the clock zoomed by, I was in a crying fit as my mom rushed me into my dress and I walked to the car with no shoes on and no makeup. Already a day I had dreamed about, planned out so perfectly was already ruined. I knew it I could feel it deep in my gut. 

The icing on the cake was when I arrived to the arena in my four inch heels and realized the floor was completely concrete, and I would have to stand for hours on it. This day could not have turned out worse. I just wanted to go home and get my diploma in the mail. 

I realized this event was not for me. I wasn't doing it for me. I was just happy to graduate and wanted to take a nap after a long 18 credit semester. I was doing all this for my family. But this moment made me realize that moments you dream about don't always turn out as planned.",3,3
67,1242,"The biggest thing to happen to me is finding out I am going to be a father. My wife and I had been trying to conceive a child for sometime now. But we hadn't had much success. However, we found out in march that we were pregnant! I can't begin to describe the excitement that I felt when I found out we were having a baby. I was so happy to find this news out as was my family! 

Then a couple months later we found out we were having a girl!! At first I was scared because being a guy I knew I didn't know all the ins and outs of what a girl goes through. The one thing I knew for sure was that there was nobody that would love this girl more than I do! I can't wait for her to get here. 

My wife and I decided on a name right away. We came to the decision rather easily without much fuss. It's a name that we have liked for some time now. My mom is also very excited about it, because my nieces from my sister are getting older now. So it'll be nice for her to have a baby to care for. 

Again this is probably the biggest moment of my life let alone the last 6 months.",3,3
68,1243,"This year both of my kids are in school. Although my older son was in school the past two years, part time and then a full day, I always had my youngest with me. I can't remember the last time I was consistently alone, well I can but it was about five years ago. Their dad works full time and is almost never home, and never does anything related to school activities. 

The first day was crazy for me. I drove to my oldest son's school and got him settled with her and made sure he was comfortable and confident starting Kindergarten. I hightailed in out of there back to the car and got my youngest back in his seat and booked it to his school. Of course we live in a ridiculous town which hasn't done construction work all summer, yet they chose the first day of school to close down the roads surrounding two of our biggest schools. 

I was already rushing because my sons are supposed to be at their school 5 minutes apart and that's not even humanly possible, although I'll still always try. Finally got to my second son's school and got inside to find his teachers, get him all signed in and I just made it in time. I said goodbye and felt bad for all the parents whose kids were screaming, crying, hitting because they didn't want to leave their parents or go to school. 

My son walked out with his class and I left the building. All these other parents were crying and visibly upset about leaving their kids at school, I literally walked out the door, stood still for a moment and took a deep breath. I finally was alone, and it was going to happen again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. 

I felt guilty all the other moms were looking at me like I'm a lunatic because I'm relieved and not bawling my eyes out. But honestly to each their own, and if they had my kids instead of theirs I can tell you they'd be the one breathing a sigh of relief. 

For the first time in five years, I have time alone.",3,3
69,1244,"A few weeks ago my boyfriend found out his roommate was going to be moving out. He was telling me about it, acting kind of nervous. We were having dinner together, we had ordered food to his apartment, and having a nice night together. He then stops eating, puts down his fork and turns to me. 

He tells me that things have been going really well with us and he's been thinking about this for awhile. He says that we spend most nights at the same apartment anyway, and, while it's not the reason he's asking, with his roommate moving out it just makes the most sense to move in together. He reassures me that he's not asking because it's convenient for him, but that he's been wanting to and it's just practical to do it now. 

We have been dating for about 2 years, and I had been thinking about taking that step too. I tell him that I think it sounds perfect, that I had been thinking about it too. We spend the night talking about how we'll handle it. We discuss where we'll live, if we'll take one of our current apartments or find a new one. 

We decide to both live at his current apartment, it's bigger than mine since I lived alone and in a good area that is convenient for both of us. It felt so good to be taking this step with him. He doesn't always like to talk about feeling so this shows me where he stand with me and our relationship. I don't remember being that happy for a long time.",3,3
70,1245,"I experienced my first train ride with my daughter approximately three months ago. We rode from Tennessee to Utah to visit my sister and her husband. Our adventure started in Nashville as a bus trip, and when we arrived in Indiana, we transferred ourselves and our luggage on a train. 

The bus trip was a little cramped, but amusing. A male passenger across from me kept cursing during his phone conversation. The bus driver had no qualms with correcting the young man's outbursts. Later during the drive, the bus driver attempted her best to not doze off. During the last leg of the trip she swerved a few times. To keep herself awake, she started to hum. The bus driver hummed louder and louder as we progressed closer and closer to the bus/train station. I was amused to the point of giggling. My daughter was not. 

My daughter didn't get much sleep the night before our trip, and she had hoped she would make up for it during our bus ride. When my daughter and I ended our bus trip and arrived in Indiana, we experienced a dull four hour layover. Maybe it was dull because it was the wee-hours of the morning. But she and I amused ourselves by cracking jokes and making silly comments. 

After the long four hours, we finally boarded the train and had begun our cozy and adventurous ride to Utah. Our first stop was in Chicago. My daughter and I had to transfer ourselves and our luggage to another train. The customer service gentleman who assisted us with the transfer was kind, comedic and inquisitive. He and I exchanged jests and sarcasms after he made an inquiry concerning our reasons for going to Utah. The customer service gentleman also joked about the size of my daughter's luggage. He stated that he was sure that he would be able to fit inside of the suitcase and tag along with us. My daughter and I were refreshed by the comical exchange with the customer service gentleman. 

After transferring our luggage, my daughter and I discovered the food court in the train station ate a delicious meal, and then made our way to the Chicago train station waiting area to begin the last half of our adventure.",2,2
71,1246,"I recently completed a project at work that did not go as planned. Before I started working for the company as a project coordinator, my boss had coordinated a fundraising effort to raise money for a well to be built on campus. The well was supposed to yield 3600 gallons of water every week. We had a biologist come out to see the land and confirm this amount. 

I was brought on to help finish the project. I felt a little uneasy about managing a project that was going to cost the company so much money, but I was glad to know my boss was looking forward to this. I would have been more nervous if I had to make the final decisions, but basically everything had already been predetermined for me; who were we going to hire, how it was going to get done, etc. 

I felt like I did a very good job keeping all the pieces moving. I didn't rush anyone, but through good communication, asking for updates, frequent reminders, and a smiling face, the project got done on time and under budget! I don't think I cut any corners. 

But the well is not producing 3600 gallons every week. It's only producing 300 gallons, nearly a tenth of what we'd been told. I don't think this is my fault, but I am now trying to figure out a reasonable explanation so my boss is not surprised. It just goes to show once again that it's important to manage expectations.",2,2
72,1247,"This happened about a month ago. I was outside with my daughter and she was playing with her friends and trying to learn how to ride a bike. I was looking at the next parking lot over and saw a few young kids riding their scooters and bikes on the side walk but going into the parking lot as well. I couldnt see anyone watching them and people zoom around here in all parking lots. 

I was paying attention to my daughter when i heard a loud thud. I knew instantly what it was. Some young kid in his supped up car smacked into of of the girls. I called 911 as i was running over the kid didnt even get out of the car. 

I stood behind him while talking to the operator in attempts to not let him leave. The kid was screaming, i think she broke her arm, and the mom finally makes her way outside. Shes with her kid screaming as im talking and waiting. 

The cops show up a few minutes later before the ambulance and take over. It was crazy but the girl in the end ive seen in a cast. It could have went a lot worse. 

Im kind of glad we have nothing going on in this town because the police were there in minutes.",2,2
73,1248,"Just last week I bought a house. I had been looking for something local that I could purchase that would fit my budget with not a lot of money down. I decided that I would make a home purchase of a double wide in my local manufactured home community. I signed the papers and felt a rush of excitement that I was finally going to be a homeowner. 

The most memorable part was when they handed me the keys and said this is now your new home. I couldn't believe it was actually ours. I wanted to find something that was large enough for my family, but that wouldn't be much upkeep. We are extremely busy people. 

The home is brand new from the factory and so is everything in it. So this is perfect for what we are looking for, and it is all ours. Very exciting! I can't believe that we are actually home owners. 

While the searching wasn't the most fun part, and we are still moving, getting to have our own home is super exciting. I can't believe it is ours. I can't believe that everything worked out and we have a place of our own.",3,3
74,1249,"A very significant day in my life in the last few months was my wedding day in June. We had been engaged for almost 9 months, and I had been stressfully planning for the last 9 months. 

The day before the wedding started off stressful. We had an issue at the rehearsal dinner with our Officiant complaining and not being very supportive of all of the changing circumstances. He made me so mad because he was making the day all about him and how it wasn't easy for him, but it's our big day! I finally snapped, then went outside with my maid of honor to calm down. He finally apologized, then we went home to rest before the big day! 

The day of the wedding I woke up early because I couldn't sleep from excitement! I went to breakfast and met my bridesmaids and mother there. I could barely eat, but managed to have a biscuit and some eggs. We then went to the salon and it took almost four hours to get all of our hair and makeup done. We had a delicious Thai lunch, which was perfect, because that's some of my favorite food. 

We then got ready and headed over the venue. It was so crazy hot, so I was standing in front of the fan and putting my feet in ice water to try to stay cool! We got our photos done, behind schedule, but finally it was time to head inside for the ceremony. People started arriving, but right at the time the ceremony was supposed to start, we had a huge thunderstorm! My husband had to run around getting everyone to help bring chairs inside. 

Luckily, the weather cleared shortly and we were able to get everything set up again and the ceremony started. It was beautiful, with a rainbow overhead and the bright sun coming out. Overall, it was a very special day and I'm so happy to be married now!",3,3
75,125,"Early this year, I found out that my mother had committed suicide, and it seriously shook my world. We had never been very close to begin with. We also hadn't talked since mid-2011, either. My mother had always told me that my father was from Ireland, but he had died by suicide when I was very young, and I never knew him. 

As a response to the grief I felt over my mom, I did a DNA test, and started to discover my Irish heritage and making contact with 400+ relatives in and around Ireland and the EU. Due to the fact that he was from there, I had automatic citizenship, but needed an Irish passport to ""prove"" it and obtain full dual citizenship. 

I spent a few months gathering all of my documentation. This included my dad's birth records from 1933 in Ireland, his military records from his service in the Korean war after moving to America years later. 

I have never felt more connected to someone I never knew. I have never felt more complete and confident of who I am and where I am going. Planning to visit and ideally move to Ireland has been the greatest gift, and one that I never expected as a result of such a massive loss of my mother to suicide. 

I literally cried for a week after I found out, and was convinced that I would never feel happy or whole again. Luckily, the universe had different plans for me than I had for myself. The universe understands we are placed here to be happy and healthy and to thrive. And I am finally catching up with the Universe, and boy, does it feel good.",3,3
76,1250,"Recently my oldest son graduated High School. It was an amazing day and I couldn't have been more proud of him and his accomplishments. It was especially emotional for me because he didn't have a typical start in life. I was 19 when I had him and I was a single parent so it was sometimes a struggle. I wanted him to always know I loved him and to fight for everything in life no matter what your circumstances are. 

The whole day was full of love, laughter, family, stories, pictures, and great food. My son stood tall and proud on the stage as he received his diploma and when he saw us in the crowd he smiled just for us. We had a party afterwards and tons of his friends came to see him and give him gifts. He also had a lot of family in town for the party including people from out of state that hadn't seen him since he was a baby. 

The only bittersweet thing about the whole day was that his biological father didn't come to see him. That was a tough pill to swallow, but my son made it. And for that I'm always going to be proud. He has his diploma now and can move on to college. He is grown up and I have done my job to get him out into the world. I will miss his teenage years (somewhat), but I am proud of him.",3,3
77,1251,"So about 3 months ago I broke up with my boyfriend. Again. Well, I didn't break up with him, he broke up with me, but I technically broke up with him the first time. It's complicated. 

Anyway, he had been really mean to me for a while, ever since we started dating--but, well, I'm really soft. When I see someone show emotion, like cry or something, I immediately change my perspective on them. I become a 'protector', or 'fixer', I guess? I wanted to help him get better. He sold me a lot of sob stories about his parents, and I ate it up. So, he became my best friend. I let it happen, because I cared about him a lot at that point, I guess? 

Psychologically, it ruined me. I became depressed and dependent. I used to not care what anyone thought about me, but I became obsessed. 

The event from 3 months ago was mind crushing, though. He told me how he just used me, how I was just ""addicted' to him, called me a bunch of sexist names and how everyone was using me and how I was dependent on others for validation. 

Now, i've never been one to care about what others think about me. I'm extremely independent, I work for my own money (we're college students), and I don't really have parents who are present, technically? But, yeah, he called me dependent and a 'drain' on his wallet, despite the fact I had spent a ton of money on him, too, despite having less. I would pay for his haircuts, his food, whenever he didn't have the money I'd spot him immediately. He never had a job, it was his parent's money and I was working 3 jobs at the peak of our relationship. 

I guess i'm still a little angry about it?",3,3
78,1252,"I took my dogs outside as normal and noticed Buttons was slower than usual. We got her in 2005 and she had been diagnosed with heart trouble. As we called her back in, she turned and looked at my mother then ran off into the dark. We waited and waited for them to come back and when we heard our little mini-pin cry out,I had a horrible feeling. I stepped onto the lawn and noticed Buttons lying in her favorite spot with Sparky at her side. She had laid down where she loved and quietly passed away. 

I picked her up and felt her limpness and I knew she was gone. It was such a horrible feeling. She was our last link to the old life we had when my father was alive. He had loved her so much and the last thing he told us was to take care of her. Buttons was with me when I went through cancer and his loss. She was with me throughout the last fourteen years and I loved her so much. 

I think that losing her has had a profound effect on me because in some way it was the end of an era. It was the end of the life in Idaho living on a farm. It was the end of days and days of her waiting for me. I think that the day we took her to be cremated was one of the most painful days. Even now, I still cry about it. 

I guess the comfort I feel is that she died on a beautiful night, in her favorite spot next to Sparky and that was a really nice way to go. I miss her so much but I have to let her go.",3,3
79,1253,"I was with Mike, a white male, 45 years old, who was a very good friend from work. We were at a Mexican restaurant where my husband and I go, frequently. There are some very nice people who work there and they all know me by sight and are always smiling and friendly. Mike, along with several other co-workers, and I went to this restaurant because I suggested it would be a great place to have lunch. As usual, everything was going great. The employees were friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very pleasant. 

Towards the end of our lunch, it started getting really busy. We were almost done eating and wanted to get our sopapillas and our check so we could get back to work. There was a busboy running around trying to keep ahead of all the customers so Mike decides to get the busboy's attention. He yells out, ""Hey, Pedro!"" to this young kid. 

I was absolutely mortified. I asked what the hell he was doing and he said he calls all Hisphanic guys, Pedro. He didn't see anything wrong with it. I did tell him how insensitive his remark was but he thought I was being overly-sensitive. I wanted to crawl under a rock. 

When we were leaving, I apologized to the young busboy and to everyone else I could see. When we got back to work, we continued to discuss the issue and I don't think I ever got through to him. I have never felt the same about him from that day forward. I know he felt the same about me.",3,3
80,1254,"Monday my daughter started “Big Girl School”!!! She has official entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn’t new to her though. She has been in Pre-K for a year so she is used to getting up, putting on a uniform and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten. 

i however am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7PM and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional “Wake Up Song”. I’ve been singing her this song since she was a baby, this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a ""big kid"" Sometimes she sings along…sometimes she pulls the covers over her head. 

I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon and fruit. Every once in a while I will let her eat her favorite cereal but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I reckon she was nervous. 

So we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunch box that looks like a purse and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time and I walked her inside. 

The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down and she covered her face!!! Later she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT ITS THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!! 

Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!",3,3
81,1255,"My wedding was on July 31st of this year. It was absolutely magical. We had rented a ranch in Colorado surrounded by mountains for the week for our family and friends to stay at. This was also the place where we held our wedding ceremony and reception. 

It felt more special than any other wedding because it was mine and I was surrounded by the people who mattered most to not only me but my husband. We had the ceremony in the backyard of the ranch, overlooking the mountains next to us. We could hear the river flowing below us as we recited our vows we wrote to each other. I will never forget seeing my husband’s face when I walked to him down the aisle. I knew I was marrying the right man when I took the tears from his eyes. 

The most magical part of the wedding was after our ceremony. We just barely had enough time to finish family photos before it started to rain over the mountains. We all ran inside and then to the pavilion. I remember standing there looking at the rain coming over the mountains and I was in awe. 

Standing there with my family and friends and new husband meant the world to me because I had just started the new chapter of my life and I had them all with me. The rain was breathtaking. I knew the rain signified that our relationship would last through anything and I constantly look back at that moment as my favorite. 

We had spent months and years planning this wedding and it was definitely the most significant aspect of my life to date. I would love to write about this event in the future.",3,3
82,1256,"A couple weeks ago for July 4th, we went up to Hiawassee, Georgia, a small mountain town on the border of North Carolina and Georgia. My sister and I were visiting our grandparents to celebrate 4th of July together. Their house was situated on a quiet cove of a lake. This lake is generally what Hiawassee has come to be known for, as it is often covered in boats and recreations. Beautiful houses line the shores of the lake and make it feel magical of sorts. 

The holiday comes around and as is tradition for those on the lake, everyone takes their boats out to another quiet cove and waits. We wait for fireworks, launched off by the city just after the moon rises. The fireworks the previous year were notably short to the disbelief of the boat goers. However this year the city had certainly made up for it with what was maybe an hour long show. It was truly incredible. American music was being played from boats in every direction. You could hear the audible gasps and excitement with each new firework. It truly was an incredible sight and time. 

Afterwards, many people hung around on their boats talking with friends and even swimming in the black of night softly lit by boat lights. I'm definitely going back again.",3,3
83,1258,"Five months ago, my life turned upside down when my mother passed away from a terminal cancer. Losing her was completely shocking and unexpected. She was young, full of life and had a heart of gold that touched everyone who ever came to know her. She was my confidant and the best grandmother to my young daughter, I could not imagine living the rest of my life without her unconditional love and support. 

I never liked May, especially because my birthday was in May and the day was always bitter-sweet for me. Although my mother always made it special, I felt sad because I never had any childhood friends to share it with. Now May took on an entirely different meaning, May was the month when my mother left this world forever, I would be left orphaned. 

I wanted to fill the last days of her life with as much love and peace as possible to repay her back for all the love and sacrifices that she did for me while I was growing up. I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings, it seemed like she could go at any moment, however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday. 

It was the most important day of her life and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly master any strength, she even signed my birthday card with three simple and yet most powerful words: "" I love you!"". I cried as I held her in my arms. 

She feel asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand. 

I cannot describe the pain of that parting, however, God's strength and my family were the only things that carried me through. At her funeral, my three-year-old daughter came up to me suddenly and said : ""Don't be sad Mommy, you have my love forever"". 

These words made my heart melt and I then understood ever so clearly that life can be summarized in three simple words : ""I love you"", just as my mother said to me before her passing. Those words can never die or be erased.",3,3
84,1259,"On may 21 of this year (2019), my very first niece had his 15 years old birthday celebration. Since she was a little baby i was waiting for this moment, because she has a personality that makes me feel like I have my sister back when she was young. That is because of several reasons. My sister is no longer with us, and she is like the memory we have about my sister. 

Now why that date was so important for me? Well, I am no exactly in my home country. I am living abroad because of my career, but for that date I wanted to jump from my place to her place, just because i cannot miss that once in a life event for my niece. I bought a flight ticket, i had a layover for about 12 hours in another country, i got sick because of the meal, but you know what? i don't regret at all. 

At the end of the day i saw her face, i saw how happy she was in her party celebration, and also she was happy to see me there. I could dance with my little niece, which is my little baby as well , and i will remember that for the rest of my life. 

I said to her that when i was in the airplane, i saw her mother in the sky, she told me to carry her, and said i love you on behalf of her. My niece was so happy, she hugged me and i whispered: your mother is so proud of you honey. I am pretty sure my sister was also dancing in the heaven. 

The night was too short, but the memories are infinites, because each second was valuable. I have to travel back the next day, without anything in my bags, but my heart full of love. Family is the treasure that will always makes your life valuable.",3,3
85,126,"The morning of giving birth, I was admitted into the hospital where I had to fill out paper work, all the ""good stuff."" My anxiety wasn't as bad, I was ready for my baby to be born. After I signed the papers, and was taken to the room where I was going to have my baby, I was given a gown. They administered an IV and gave me medicine to speed up my labor. 

About an hour later, the doctor came in and broke my water. Afterwards, they told me to just get comfortable and try to rest, that it was a waiting game. My contractions were getting a little more intense, but nothing I couldn't handle. I decided to watch a little TV. I couldn't go to sleep, I was too anxious. Nurses were coming in to check my monitor, IV, and to see how far I was dilated. 

I can't remember exactly what time I got my epidural, but I decided to go ahead and get it before it was too late. I was at a 6 or 7cm at this point. The doctor who put the epidural in, had to take it out and redo it because I was still able to feel places I wasn't suppose to. After the second attempt, it was good to go. I was numb mainly on one side. As it would wear off, I was able to feel my contractions, so the nurses would come in and push the button for more. So far everything was good, the pain was manageable. I had family and friends come in and out. 

Around 7pm, my contractions were getting stronger, and my epidural was not working. The nurses would come in and check my cervix and see how far I was dilated. I was already feeling the urge to push, but they wouldn't let me. Around 8-8:30pm, the nurses came back in because I was in crucial pain. I was trying to jerk the IV out of my hand, took off the baby monitor because I didn't want anything on me or touching me. I was vomiting, and sweating up a storm. They then confirmed I could start pushing. 

An hour straight of pushing, my baby was finally born at 9:56pm!",3,3
86,1260,"There was a recent event that happened last Tuesday that was pretty interesting and memorable. I was shopping in a grocery store and there was quite a few people there that day. When I was shopping, I went to grab a griddle, but as I grabbed it there was a woman right behind me who started questioning me and cussing me out for taking the last available griddle. I had to defend my purchase, so I just ignored her and kept shopping. 

Later on, I left my cart alone and noticed that the woman took my griddle out of my shopping cart, which pretty infuriating. I secretly ""stole"" it back into my cart without her noticing and watched her checkout without realizing it was gone. I felt bad but at the same time I found the griddle first. I wish that I could have seen her realize that she didn't have the griddle in the parking lot but I didn't get the chance to see this woman again. 

I felt proud that I was able to get the last griddle and I have no regrets. I think it is absolutely ridiculous to get angry at a stranger for something like that. If possible, I would have recorded this situation and uploaded it because I just think it's funny. 

Anyway, the griddle works perfectly and for only $20 I am satisfied with my purchase. I made pancakes with it this morning and some eggs. I still think about it though with some shame. I hate being mean to people but this was my griddle, once again.",2,2
87,1261,"A moment that meant a lot to me that occurred recently was attending graduation from college. I had spent the last four years in school and all my hard work had finally paid off. 

As I was getting dressed in the back, my mind was racing. I was surrounded by my friends and future colleagues. We can all say that we had finally made it to the finish line. All those long nights and the endless amount of homework was finally coming to an end. Many of had jobs lined up for us and if we didn't we were excellent prospects. 

As the lady in the front gave the signal, we all lined up and walked into the reception area, we were all greeted by our loved ones. The ones who stood by us and supported us as we made this transition into the ""real world"". 

We sat silently as they called our names. As the names were called, we one by one, stood and shook the president of the school's hand. We each took a quick photo and moved to accept our diploma. 

All the cheering and support bought tears to my eyes. It was happy and sad tears. I was sad to see all my friends go in different directions, but I was happy that they were all starting a new chapter in their lives. The graduation was short, but it was a memorable one.",3,3
88,1262,"I am pregnant, and with that has come all sorts of thrills and fears. Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. 

I became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though. I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. 

In that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head. 

This was a beautiful moment in our relationship and in my pregnancy.",3,3
89,1263,"The event that I remember the most is the death of my uncle whom I was very close to. He got very sick with pneumonia, and went to the hospital. When he was in the hospital they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. 

While he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. 

The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath. 

I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years. 

Life goes on, but it certainly will be a lot sadder without him.",3,3
90,1264,"A big chunk of my family attended the ELO concert in Atlanta on July 5th of this year. I come from a very large family (I'm the youngest of 7) and there were 10 of us total who attended the concert. It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT. It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. 

This event was also memorable for one other reason. My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale. He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife. She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live. 

Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert. She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm. She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late. She passed away that night. We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable. 

My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away. He said it just didn't feel right. After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go. His oldest son took her place. It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed. 

We miss her terribly - and we will always miss her terribly - and the concert was dedicated to her.",3,3
91,1265,"I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention. This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come. 

The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry, and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low. 

The funds, I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation. 

Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. 

On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place. I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot of money for many years. 

The confidence I had in my driving has still not come back, and this makes me feel like I lack ability and weak-minded. I hope this passes, because I do not like feeling worse about my life. I will have to work on getting my confidence back, and reducing the amount of daily worry I have. 

This was not a great day or experience, and has definitely impacted my life each day since August 5th, but I think it will pass soon and I can have finally my mind and confidence back.",3,3
92,1266,"In late May of 2019 I had an overdose at a unexpected time in my life. I was going through many things such as my mother being in a comatose state, me losing my job, and falling in love with someone who didn't deserve me. During this time I fell back deeply in love with something other than myself or another person. I fell back on something that was dependable and reliant. I fell back on drugs. I knew that it would happen to someone, but never that it would happen to me. 

I couldn't bring myself to believe that I would someday need Naloxone to be revived from the point of death twice. The effects of the drugs started to happen around 7:00 pm est when I started to go into a heavy sleep. My friend pulled the car over to assist me in waking up and start CPR on me until the ambulance arrived. 

It took the ambulance about 15 minutes to get there, and to administer the Naloxone. At this point I was unconscious with no pulse until the Naloxone was administered. Once inside of the ambulance I died once more with no pulse until the EMT attendants started CPR and resuscitated me. 

I ended up going to the nearest hospital which was about 25 minutes away. I was kept in isolation for about six hours while the nurses and doctors ran test on me. I ended up having side effects from the situation. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, collapsed lungs, and bruised lungs. 

I was released from the hospital that night, but had to return for a two day stay at the commonwealth hospital. I had never felt so drained in my life before until this moment where i felt like i could just rest, and finally be safe.",3,3
93,1267,"Over the Memorial Day holiday in the United States, my family of 12 and I went on a family vacation. We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. 

This vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. 

There were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. 

Every morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. 

That evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. 

After everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying. Nope, FOOD POISONING!!! While it was not funny at the time because I was literally thinking that I was dying, I look back now and laugh because everyone talks about me getting food poisoning and the shape that I was in. Lucky for them, I took one for the team.",2,2
94,1268,"Just this past Wednesday on August the 21st I performed my Grandfathers funeral. He was 91 and an inspiration to me. I am actually his name sake and named after him. It was a great honer to do his eulogy and cover the wonderful accomplishments of such a great man that I have looked up to my entire life. All of my family were in attendance, which was a great thing as most of us haven't seen one another in many years. My grandfather always cared about family and made family the point and purpose of his life. Unfortunately, it required his passing to remind us of the that value. He fathered six children and had 9 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren and they were all in attendance to honor his home going! 

Just two years before, in the same month I did my father's funeral and everyone was in attendance there as well. I mention this because at my grandfather's funeral the place was packed, save one empty chair. It was a touching thought that there was one chair left in honor of my father. I mentioned this in the eulogy and hoped that all in the family who know that there is a chair in our home and at the table for every one of them! 

During the funeral I preached a message as well on the lives that are lived as an anchor for others. My Grandfather was most certainly an anchor for all of us as well as grandpa and grandmas house was an anchor for our souls when traveling into town. I also expressed how our faith anchors us in the decisions that we make in life. That many time we can drift too far off course and that life has a way of blowing from our course through storms. Although the winds of life are experienced by everyone, we do not have to allow them to shipwreck us or our faith. Through faith and trust we hold on and are anchored to the rock! 

This was the way that my grandpa lived and that is the way that I hope to live my life as well. In all it was a bitter sweet event for me and there were tears of sadness and of joy. I am glad that my family trusted me to minister to all in this trying time. I was very humbled and honored to do it.",3,3
95,1269,"I have been dating Michelle for nearly three years. In June we went to Rome, Italy for a week long vacation she had booked for us. It was a trip of a lifetime for me as I had rarely traveled anywhere outside of the United States. We left Dallas and flew to London for a 6 hour layover. It was long enough where we could leave the airport and experience a little of the area before flying on to Rome. 

After a few days in Rome touring all of the sites I had only read about we had dinner at an extremely fancy restaurant. It was there that my life changed for the better. I was widowed about ten years ago and I didn't think I would ever marry again. Much to my surprise Michelle proposed to me. I know it isn't the traditional way this was supposed to work but I was floored. 

My heart and mind were racing that I don't even remember saying yes but she said I accepted right away. The look on her face made me the happiest man in the world. I truly believe we were destined to be together but it took me some nudging to make me realize it for real. 

For the rest of the trip I was walking on air. I have finally found happiness in my life again. I felt like the luckiest person on earth.",3,3
96,127,"We recently visited a child that we are considering adopting. He is in the foster care system and we are hoping that when he gets out of the treatment center he will have learned new behaviours that will make it easier for him to have a successful adoption experience in our home. 

The trip to the facility was distant. It was busy with traffic and it seemed like a rather scary undertaking. We had to rent a car and drive in a strange area. 

We arrived at the destination. We then went into the building and it seemed more like a prison than a place a child would be living. They immediately had to take any cell phones. They then proceeded to check us for weapons. Then they would unlock each door we entered. 

It was definitely a maximum security type of place. It seemed unusual to us that a child under 13 would need to be in a maximum security type environment for simply having Autism. 

The facility we visited has kids of all kinds separated into units, some are court ordered, some are private pay and some are insurance paid. I think most parents would be alarmed if their autistic child was put in a place like that. It had no real atmosphere of a real home. I would rate it as terrible.",3,3
97,1270,"Today I got to take part in a celebration to mark Nick & Bec's 20 Anniversary. I was asked to be part of the ceremony by writing and presenting 5 Haikus about their relationship. When I got to the party, I was amazed at the number of old friends of mine that were also attending the event. I knew at least 45 of the 50 or so attendees, although there were some folks I hadn't seen in years. The party gave me an unexpeected chance to catch up with so many of these old friends. It was so nice to see so many people I love and to get to celebrate one of my favorite couples with them all. 

It also was very energizing to have so many friends together and it made me feel very happy and grateful I have so many amazing people in my life. It's hard not to be happy when you realized you are so blessed. 

The ceremony itself was beautiful. Both the bride and groom looked lovely and were happy and upbeat. Everyone seemed to be in a great and appreciative mood and the ceremony went off without a hitch. My haikus were well received, and people laughed and ""ahhhed"" at all the points I had hoped they would. It made me feel very special that I was only 1 of 2 people who had been asked to contribute and speak at the ceremony, and I was grateful I got to contribute. 

After the ceremony, the food and reception were also fabulous. I stayed at the party almost 4 hours before heading home. Even then it was hard to leave because there were so many folks I wanted more time to catch up with. 

I went home happy and energized by all the friendship and love from the night.",3,3
98,1271,"About four months ago, my wife and I sold our first family home. We have a large family. It is my wife and I plus five children. Our oldest daughter started asking us about having her own room. Although we loved that house, we knew it was time to get something bigger. 

Luckily, we sold it after being on the market for only three days. We found a house with more bedrooms quickly, and the whole process was as smooth as it could have been. 

However, it is bittersweet looking back on everything. That house was very special to me. I did a lot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learn and love there. We made so many good memories. We charted how our children grew on a closet door (which is probably still there). It was a wonderful house while it lasted, but things happen and we had to let it go. 

As of today, I can still remember every little nook and cranny of that place. After all, it has only been a few months. However, it is sad to think these memories will eventually fade. 

I love our new house, but that first one will always hold a special place in my heart.",3,3
99,1272,"A week ago, I was having pain in my back. I thought it was just normal wear and tear until the pain got worse in the afternoon. It was so sharp and felt like something was squeezing on my insides. It no longer seemed like it was routine back pain so I decided to go to the emergency room. It took forever for someone to see me, and I was worried because the pain continued. 

A nurse came in to see me, asked what my symptoms were, and then told me I would need to undergo some tests. I waited some more hours before the big scanning machine was available. The scan was painless, and after I was done, I went to use the bathroom since I was told the doctor would come talk to me soon. 

I immediately felt the pain disappear after using the bathroom. When I was waiting for the doctor, a nurse came in the room and told me the doctor would be in shortly, she was just on the phone with the radiologist. I immediately felt panic set in. Why would she be talking to a radiologist? I thought the worst and believed that I must have had something very seriously wrong with me. I started to think of all of the things I was going to miss out in life, and felt extremely sad and hopeless. 

When the doctor arrived, she didn't have a gloomy expression on her face, so I felt hopeful. She said that I had kidney stones. I immediately felt better, even though kidney stones are serious. I didn't know that radiologists look over all the scans the machine does. I thought they only got involved if it was a very serious disease. 

I told her that I felt better after using the bathroom, and she said that it was possible I already passed the kidney stone. Just to be sure, she gave me medications to shrink any stones and to help heal quicker. I was so relieved after that. I felt like I had a new lease on life, and decided to commit myself to eating healthier and drinking much more water.",3,3
100,1273,"After two attempts at taking the law school admissions test, I had received a respectable score. I took several weeks to craft a personal statement to send to three law schools. I waited until the last possible day, of each law school's admission cycle, to submit my applications. 

One law school rejected me; it was the highest ranking school. Over the next two weeks, the other two law schools both accepted me and offered me 60% scholarships to attend their programs. Unfortunately, both schools offered these scholarships with conditions. The conditions seemed completely attainable- do not fall below the bottom 20% of the class, for one, and to stay above a 2.33 GPA for the other. 

Both of the schools that accepted me were relatively high-ranking schools. The dean of the higher ranking of the two schools requested a conference with me to discuss my options and any concerns I might have. Initially, that school had offered me a 40% scholarship but during this conversation the dean raised my scholarship offer from 40% to 60%, unsolicited. 

I attempted at that time to further negotiate my scholarship details- the conditions only. The dean expressed he would bring my concerns up with the admissions committee and contact me back with a determination. The admissions committee sent out my revised scholarship offer soon after, however the conditions were still attached. 

After long consideration, I withdrew my applications from both law schools. My goal was and continues to be to obtain 100% scholarship for law school. I will be retaking the LSAT and reapplying earlier in the upcoming cycle.",1,1
101,1274,"My husband and I tried to help his brother get off drugs by allowing him to stay at our home for several weeks. He shoots up regularly and has damaged himself so badly that at one point doctors thought his arm might need to be amputated. His girlfriend texted me begging us to help him. At first my husband was reluctant, but I was afraid that his brother would overdose and then he would feel guilty that he hadn't helped him, so I convinced him to do it. 

It was a difficult time for me and my family because it's hard watching someone you care about go through such a painful experience. It disrupted our regular routine and made life more hectic. He didn't follow the house rules we set and didn't get along well with my husband while he was here. He refused to go to rehab, so even though it was hard we felt like we didn't have much choice. 

He got really sick while he was with us and got upset because we wouldn't help him get more drugs. He has a tendency to feel sorry for himself, which really gets on my nerves, and so the tension was high. It made life difficult for my kids, which really upset me. 

It was not a good time for our family and I wish now that we hadn't made the choice to invite him in because it didn't really help. He left our home and started taking drugs again and is still upset with both of us. He avoids us at family gatherings, writes unkind things about us on Facebook and acts as though it's our fault that he's still on drugs. Also, his girlfriend kicked him out and he's virtually homeless now, which he also tries to partially blame on us.",3,3
102,1275,"My 28th birthday was probably the best in my life. My cousin is 3 days younger than me and we celebrated our birthdays together. I remember that we went to our favorite park and invited lots of friends and lots of family. We had two grills cooking lots of burgers, hot dogs, different meats like steak, sausage and ribs. We all ate and laughed and played water guns, and water balloons. 

I got a new nintendo switch that day and so did my cousin, with the same game. The new pokemon game that came out that year. It was truly special because I have been wanting it for years and I finally gotten it. We played for hours and even had to take a break. I will never forget those moments as me and my cousin played side by side for hours on a day between our birthdays. We truly felt like we shared those moments. 

We caught pokemon that was different than each others and we battled them as we caught new ones. We just simply linked our gameboys and played agianst each other. People at the party were watching us and even rooting for me and my cousin as we had intense matches that day. All lower level pokemons. 

Me and my cousins are some big time fans of pokemon. The people at the party thought we were ridiculous for playing games like this but this makes us happy!",2,2
103,1276,"Last week, I was walking down the street and I saw a man that I usually see on my way to work. Today I noticed that he was crying and looking very down. Usually I just walk past him but today I felt like I needed to talk to him. I could feel that he was going through something terrible and needed some help. I slowed down, and I stood next to him and looked at him for a moment. 

Finally, I mustered up the courage to ask him what was going on. He told me that he had found out that he was ill and would not have long to live. He said that he had always felt like he could manage his life the way it was. He said that after he found out this news he felt that his life was worthless. He told me that he had not wanted to eat for days and that it was hard for him to eat anyway. 

Due to the fact that he had very little money and very little support it was hard for him to muster up the strength to fend for himself. I sat down next to him and spoke with him for a while about what he was going through and offered to buy him something to eat. He accepted, and told me that I was the only one who had stopped and talked to him in months. He told me that it was a very helpful and that he would try and pick himself up from here on out. 

I felt so grateful that I had made such a big impact on him. It made me feel like I wanted to do more to help people around me. Not only was I able to uplift his spirits but my own as well.",3,3
104,1277,"A situation that comes to mind as one that was striking and memorable happened around 2 weeks ago. I was relaxing at home, and my fiancee was in our bedroom watching TV. She called me into the room, telling me she had to show me something. I was expecting it to be a funny picture of our cat, or a video she found that I would be interested in. Instead, when I walked into the bedroom she handed me a home pregnancy test. She told me she was pregnant, she had just taken the test and wanted to tell me right away. 

I was so surprised. We were not really trying to get pregnant, but we were so excited right away. I couldn't believe that this was a journey we were going to start taking together. Later that night, we spent a long time sitting and talking about everything. We went over some decisions we are going to have to make for our baby, and how we would make them. She asked me for help finding a doctor and getting an appointment set up. 

This was all stuff that would have normally been so boring, but it wasn't. It was for our baby, so we were having fun even figuring out insurance things. Everything went by so fast, and I kept feeling more and more excited about the situation and everything that is yet to come.",3,3
105,1278,"A recent memorable event in my life was when I was surprised to be invited to Disney World by my mother in law. She said she would pay for everything and basically all I had to do was show up. She was meeting her daughter and granddaughter there and had enough money that I could come too. 

I almost didn't go because Disney World is crowded and it can be hard to hang out with a four year but I had not seen that part of the family in awhile, my schedule was clear, and it had been 12 years since I had been to Disney World. So I decided to go. 

My favorite days were when it was just my mother in law and I and we went to Harry Potter at Universal. The theme park was so well done and the rides were really fun and the butter beer was really good. The main big ride I ended up going by myself because my mother in law didn't want to go. It was kind of scary but it was really fun and so well done with 3D effects and lighting. It was too crowded to go wand shopping but that is okay because my husband got me a wand previously when he was in Orlando for a work trip.

We also had fun with my niece, she liked anything to do with Frozen. We had lots of good food, rode on some fun rides. I liked eating at the dinosaur theme restaurant. It was basically Rainforest Cafe but with dinosaurs. 

The hotel we stayed in was Little Mermaid theme so that was really cute. But it was kind of noisy and the buses were far away for our hotel. 

Overall it was a really fun trip and I am glad I went, but I would not be going back any time soon. It is so crowded there and dealing with that many people can be really hard.",2,2
106,1279,"I was on a trip to Italy and I had been thinking about past friends I had not seen recently. I was in Florence at the time and went to bed feeling a bit melancholic about these friends and past moments in my life. A few hours later I was woken up by a text from a close friend, it was the middle of the night for me but since it was someone texting from the U.S. the time was much earlier for them. The text asked if I had heard about a different friend. I immediately had a sinking feeling in my stomach. I replied that I hadn't, and immediately knew that bad news was coming. He explained that my friend had been found dead on the beach just a few short hours before. I was stunned. 

My mind was racing. Was this a drowning? Was it an illness? The reality was that my friend had just become another statistic in the opiate epidemic. He had died of a heroin overdose while sitting on the beach. I was devastated. I could not go to sleep and laid restless for the remainder of the night. 

I got up in the morning and began wandering around the city in a haze. I was on a trip of my life and I could not just sit around and mourn. However, I was tinged with sadness in everything I did. I was in one of the most beautiful cities on earth and everything was a reminder of life, death, friendship, and emotion. My eyes would well up with tears every so often as I attempted to go about my day and visit different sights. 

It was an unbelievably beautiful day. There was a golden sunlight touching every surface, streaming through windows. I ended the day in the 1000 year old monastery of San Miniato al Monte, thinking about life and how it was so precious and fleeting. I was filled with emotion and remembrance, knowing that I would remember this moment forever, for good and bad reasons.",3,3
107,128,"A few weeks ago, I decided to take a week long vacation with my family. We decided to go to Cancun, Mexico, and it was a fantastic experience. I loved the ocean and the white sand. My kids had a wonderful time at the beach and I had a great time just relaxing myself sipping on a mango margarita. The most memorable experience is that we went to an event at Xcaret, where we attended to a performance about the Mayan Civilization. 

Our experience at the hotel was also very pleasurable. We had the all-included service and we loved it. Out hotel had 5 different restaurants ( Mexican, American, Chinese, Gourmet, and one with a mixture of all 5). The service staff was friendly at all times, and we even received tickets for another attraction. 

Our vacation in Cancun was the best we have had so far, and it helped us spend time together as a family. Cancun is just like a paradise, it has everything that we needed to have a great time as a family. When I saw my little twin boys smiling and enjoying the attraction I realized that it was an unforgettable experience for all of us. We have been to other places but for some reason we never truly loved the place, there was always something that didn't work well, but in this case everything went great. 

I still believe that Cancun has everything that makes an unforgettable experience. I am planning to go back with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary (just the two of us) to enjoy a romantic dinner and enjoy the attractions for adults that we did not get to see as a family.",2,2
108,1280,"My nephew was hurt on the job, a place he goes daily with no care in the world. A place we never expected this to happen. And the seriousness of the injury was intense. Broken jaw, knocked unconcious - very much out of it and not well, he needed wires in his jaw and a very big amount of surgery. All this from being too hungry and passing out and being sick. 

I felt something was a tad off that night, almost a gut feeling if you will, but I didn't think anything of it, until the text messages started pouring in the next morning. I was very upset and nervous, and it brought back many bad memories and feelings of my own personal experience in 2008 - a dangerous car accident. 

In my accident I too suffered fractures to my face and bones. It brought back many memories from a bad time. Based on what the paramedics stated, it was a scene of horrors. Blood was everywhere, and his lip had split with his teeth actually protruding through his lower jaw. Having to be instantly sedated due to shock, he became quite sick. 

We all got together and prayed. It was all we could so in this situation. Thankfully, he is now on the mend. I'm his Uncle, this had a pretty profound affect on me. I was sullen and down, thinking about many things past and present. But we look forward to a bright future.",3,3
109,1281,"I have always wanted a surprise birthday celebration and sadly i have never gotten one. I just alluded it to my husband recently and i didn't know he had something in the pipeline for me. That day he was suppose to be out of town so i wasn't really expecting any surprises, i just felt it would be one of those boring birthdays when i would just receive calls from my loved ones and probably blow a cake. 

So after my usual day at work, where i didn't even get a happy birthday from my colleagues, I was kind of pissed so i headed home immediately after work. As i got home i heard a thunderous happy birthday and i literally jumped out of my skin. Tears of joy kept rolling down from my eyes, my colleagues were already there. My husband just made the story of having to travel and my kids were all smiles. 

I was really ecstatic, what surprised me most was my parents took out time to travel for my special day even though my mum was down with stage 2 cancer. I had gifts from my husband and my friends. The love showed to me was unfathomable. I really wanted to get a necklace which i saw at a store some days back and to my surprise it was among the gifts i received. 

I have never had a surprise birthday party before and this was a new and exciting experience for me. I love my husband but this surprise made me love and cherish him more. I really can't wait for another birthday party. As for my kids they sang me a birthday song. This was totally the most awesome experience i have ever had.",3,3
110,1282,"I'm feeling lost. Back in May I received the news that I was once again being dismissed from the nursing program at Randolph Community College. After putting in sweat, tears and many countless hours I was angry more than anything when I heard the words, ""unfortunately, we cannot let you continue into the program."" I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. 

But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. 

I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, ""well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?"" 

Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are ""safe"" and that we will receive help. 

I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward. Here is to better opportunities and a brighter future. I can't go anywhere but up from here. This is just a bump in the road.",3,3
111,1284,"I just got back from a vacation, and as is often said, I need a vacation from my vacation now! My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. 

I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. 

We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery. 

Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",3,3
112,1285,"I always had a fun childhood. My parents saw to it that I had a lot of great times to look back on and cherish. In the spirit of that, I wanted to pass on experiences like this to my daughter. 

This weekend, I decided to take a step forward to do that and bought a projector for my daughter. This projector will enable us to watch movies using a large screen or an empty wall. So, this weekend, I decided to set up a backyard movie night. 

I took the deck furniture and arranged it on the lawn to look like a living room. Then, I spread a moving blanket down to give us a clean area to walk. I set up a card table with the projector and DVD player along with the appropriate cords. I then put the screen together and anchored it to the ground using stakes. The screen was up against the side of the house to protect it from the wind. 

I tested the projector on the screen and it looked amazing. The sound quality was even good as well. 

Once I had everything set up, we popped some popcorn and got snacks. Finally, we told our daughter and she was super excited. She ran out to the yard and her face lit up as we all gathered around and watched Secret Life of Pets 2. It was an amazing night and I'm so glad I did it.",2,2
113,1286,"About two months ago, I began working at my practicum placement for my graduate school practicum requirement. During this time, I have gotten to know my practicum supervisor and have had the opportunity to learn a lot about the students who attend the school. In particular, I have gotten to know the Kindergarteners and first graders very well. 

There is one particular kindergartener, a blonde-haired little boy with none of his front teeth and a long braid down his back, that I have come to enjoy seeing around school. About two weeks ago, he came up to me and was crying. He grabbed me in an embrace and told me how much he wanted ""Picture Day"" to last all day. His mother had dressed him up and styled his braid with extra care that morning. He clearly was very excited about how nice he looked but was having a hard morning. 

He looked very precious and it put a smile on my face. He shared with me that he was feeling sad and really needed a friend that morning. We got him his breakfast and made our way into my office. After opening up his chocolate milk and juice cartons, he started to cry and leaned his head against the wall. He doubted that he could make it through the whole day without getting his picture taken at least twice. 

I felt sad to see him so upset. He jumped up from his chair and hugged me around my waist, still crying. I talked to him about how hard school can be and how brave he was. He told me that he felt better. 

The other day, he picked up his school pictures and I found a portrait signed by him sitting on my desk. It made me feel very happy and loved by this little boy I had come to know so well.",3,3
114,1287,"I was driving in a wealthy Southern California town when my back right tire blew out. I had just attended a lecture at the time, and I found the content extremely emotionally draining, so I wasn't in an excellent mood to begin with. The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled ""no stopping any time."" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. 

A woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, ""The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME."" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. 

An older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me. My stomach dropped with dread. While I am generally not a cruel person and welcome interactions with people in unfortunate situations, being stuck as I was in ninety degree heat with drivers around me shouting angrily and honking, I wasn't in the most convenient position to help anyone. I didn't have any cash with me to give him, and I didn't know if I could handle a heart-wrenching conversation about how horrendous life can be or learning about the man's visions from God, if he had them. It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. 

My anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car. I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire. There were tears in my eyes when I thanked him. 

We talked for a little while; he'd been a teacher once. He didn't go into specifics about his current situation. I offered to take him to dinner, but he refused. He told me to drive safely, and then he walked away. I'm convinced this man was some kind of guardian angel. I'm so grateful to him.",3,3
115,1288,"One night in June, I went to the gym to burn off some excess energy and clear my head so I'd fall asleep more easily. I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. 

She tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why; I briefly considered walking away from the situation. 

The anger welled up in me and I knew I had to give her a piece of my mind about what had become a disturbing habit of alcohol abuse. I raised my voice and told her it didn't matter how my day was, because she ruined it by getting excessively intoxicated when she knew it was something that greatly upset. She looked at me with an expression of confusion and sloppily said she was sorry. I yelled at her that she wasn't sorry because she kept behaving that way even though she knew how much it upset me, and it was better not to lie. 

I told her she was a selfish person and she had a problem, and if she was going to be a liar, she should learn to do a better job of it or just not talk to me at all. I grabbed my laptop and stormed out of the room, exiting to my bedroom. 

I went into my adjoining bathroom, slamming the door open so hard that it knocked the towel rack through the drywall. I looked at my angry face in the mirror and wondered why I allowed such a pathetic person to upset me so greatly. She wasn't worth it.",3,3
116,1289,"A few months ago I was trying to get on top of my financial situation. I am three years out of school now with student loans to be repaid. I thought it would be a responsible thing to do. I decided to run a full credit report on myself as I have never done one before. I never understood why my credit score was so low. I have always made payments on time, never kept a balance, and barely used my cards. 

When I saw the results, I was shocked. I had two credit cards that were basically maxed out that I never knew about. I called the company that said I had accounts there and they said payments were being made on them so it doesn't seem to be fraud and I should ask people I know. 

So, it turns out my own parent had falsely opened the cards under my name. I had 12,000 in credit card debt because of that associated with my name. And this is on top of my student loans! 

I was so upset and hurt by this. I forced her to find a way to pay it back and get it off my name. Eventually she did. I am still hurt and weary of it all.",3,3
117,129,"Three weeks ago, I was driving my sister to elementary school. After just a few minute of driving, a large deer ran from a nearby tree and in front of my car. I barely had time to react and hit the brakes too late. Unfortunately, the car was wrecked with much of the front end of the car being demolished by the force of the impact of the deer. 

My sister and I lay still for a moment, immobilized by shock and fear. I then quickly unbuckled my seat belt and checked on my sister, who was also wearing her seat belt. She was safe. Besides having some minor whiplash, I was also safe. 

This event has been reiterated in my mind dozens of time since it took place. I wonder what would have happened if my sister or I was seriously hurt or killed. I contemplate the fragility of life and existence. 

At the time of the accident, I was a nervous wreck, but since then I have been contemplating the purpose of life. I wonder every day when will my life end. When it does end, will I have made the most of it? 

I'm grateful everyday I survived that accident. It has allowed me to reevaluate my life. I now consider the path I am taking and whether it suits me best.",3,3
118,1290,"Earlier this summer, my neighbor---who I have known my entire life of 34 years---suddenly passed away. At first, I was very shocked. I had just sat down with her around my birthday, and while she mentioned having back pain, she was still sharp as a knife and not sick. 

I have lived in this house forever (as I inherited it from my parents when they passed away, back when I was in college). I grew up knowing this neighbor. I viewed her as part of my extended family. She would always walk her adorable Yorkie dog down the street, and if I were outside, she would stop to talk to me about the day. 

When I learned of her passing, I decided to attend her funeral. Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six. He cared a lot for our neighbor, too, but he is so young he doesn't quite understand the concept of mortality yet. I didn't want to expose him to her if her casket was open. (It was.)

At the funeral, I talked to other neighbors who were equally upset and sad. I hugged her family. I watched a slideshow of photos that also showed her husband, who had passed away earlier. I liked him, too. 

Now her children are planning to sell her house, and I'm a little nervous. I've never had a new neighbor so close before.",2,2
119,1291,"In August of this year, I went with my wife and our kids, along with my father in law and my sister in law and her family to spread the ashes of my mother in law. We hiked up a trail in the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction Colorado, to one of her favorite spots to visit. It took about half an hour to get there. It was my first time going, but my wife and kids had gone before when my mother in law was not sick. 

When we got to the spot, a large cliff overlooking the area, we took a few minutes to look around and enjoy the scenery. Then we found a small juniper tree that sat near the edge, and my father in law spread the ashes around the base. My kids hung up some trinkets they had brought that reminded them of their grandma, and everyone had brought a stone from her collection to stack on the spot. 

After we had done this, my father in law sat down and started crying. It was hard to watch, as he had never displayed that kind of emotion around me before. My older daughter sat down next to him and they just sat there for a while and looked out on the valley ahead of them. She was the most in tune with her grandfather of all the grandchildren. She was the oldest, and had recently spent several months living with her grandparents, and had really grown to be close with them. 

After they had sat for a while and came to terms with the moment, we went to one of my mother in law's favorite mexican restaurants to have dinner. We all talked about the memories we had of her, and her personality traits that stood out. My wife had a peach margarita in her honor, as that was one of her favorite drinks.",3,3
120,1292,"This happened about 3 months ago. I was driving with my brother back from the movie theater when we were sideswiped by another car. It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying. It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures. We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop. We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were. 

We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay. The other driver got out of their car and was obviously under the influence. You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away. My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought. 

The other driver looked to be in his mid 20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police. The police got there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed miserably. I exchanged information with one of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come. The other driver was arrested and my car was towed away. 

It is the only major accident I've ever been in besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots. Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay. It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for. I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other driver, but his insurance settled out with us. 

Ironically, my car was salvaged out about a month later due to hail damage (somehow that was more costly than this accident).",3,3
121,1295,"There are some memorable days in my life and they remain ever green in my heart. My first day of school is such a day. It was the month of January 2003. I was then only six years old. My father proposed that i should be admitted into a school in class on the next day. I felt very excited i could not think of anything else. I was always thinking about the school, the teachers, as i watched on TV. I could not even sleep well that night. 

The next morning my mother woke me early in the morning, she washed me very well, combed my hair and dressed me in new clothes. Then i had breakfast and started for school with my father. He took me to the nearest CFB primary school at 9:30 am. The school was not very far from our home, so we walked all the way, it took us about 30 minutes to get to the school. 

When i stepped into the school compound with my father i was somewhat afraid. I saw many student s on the school campus, some were playing, some where talking to each other. Finding myself in a new environment my heart started to beat, at first my father took me to the headmaster's room and requested him to admit me in first grade, i was nervous but his smiling face and and gentle eyes put me to ease. He asked me my name and i answered him. then he pointed me to a letter chart and asked me to say some letters. I could say them all because my mother taught me how to say it at home. Then he became very pleased at me and admitted me to first grade, then he called Ms Fatema the first grade teacher to take me to class. 

When i entered the class all the students in the class where staring at me, i felt a bit nervous once again to see the new faces, i sat down and at my leisure period, all my classmate started playing in the field, i felt very lonely and was loitering here and there, then they invited me to join them, i started playing, i felt myself like a free bird flying in the open sky. 

My school ends at 12pm, my mother was at the gate to receive me. I leapt into her arms she kissed me and caught me in her arms. That was how i spent my first day of school. I left the school with a new experience and a cheerful mind. I shall never forget that day as long as i live.",3,3
122,1296,"Exactly three months ago today, I had the worst experience of my life. I could not eat without vomiting. I could not sleep for the pain. I was in desperate need of a doctor but didn't have health insurance. I waited as long as I could and finally when my eyes began turning yellow and my skin a yellowish orange color, I decided it was time to go to the emergency room. I was concerned of how I would pay for a visit but I knew something was wrong. It was almost like I could feel death approaching me. 

When I came into the emergency department, I was immediately triaged and when the doctor examined me, his first words to the nurse was, ""Book an OR, stat!"". That was scary but at that point I was a the mercy of the physicians. I prayed to God, asking for his protection. Ten minutes later, I was under anesthesia, grasping at life. 

The initial surgery took 2 hours and the second surgery took 11 hours. In recovery, the doctor explained to me that I had to be opened up and fixed. My gallbladder had gall stones and those gall stones had acted like bullets inside my body when my gallbladder had burst open. The gallstones tore through my pancreas, liver, and right kidney. They had to go in and do some repairs. 

While the ordeal was traumatic and scary, it is a constant reminder that in a blink of an eye, I could have been 6 feet under right now. I am thankful I went to the hospital when I did. I am still unsure how to pay for the $800,000 bill, but I suppose that is the cost of my life. 

Today I am a healthy 39 year old female who has an incredible deep red and ugly abdominal scar, but has the hope of a future.",3,3
123,1297,"Within this year I have gone back to college to get my degree in science. For years I have not gone to college because of my physical and mental health but decided to try because I have always wanted to complete college. It was hard. My skin condition made it painful to sleep let alone study and attend class. I sprained my ankle, got the flu and almost quit but I kept going despite having every excuse not to. 

Then by the end of the semester I was given a ''fun'' assignment by our Psychology professor to do something that would make us feel uncomfortable and write how we overcame that. At the same time I had to give a Ted Talk style speech in my Writing and Research class so this was a great opportunity to do both. I felt uncomfortable and I even regretted it at first but I was able to complete both of my assignments and ended up getting a B+ for each of those classes while getting As for my Math and History class. 

This was a roller coaster of emotions but I'm glad I did it. Now I'm stronger to continue on to my next semester which is just one week away. I was surprised at myself. I quit college 3 times the first semester before this so I was afraid I would have to pay for it all again. But it was worth it. 

Now I'm a step closer to my goal and I feel that I'm not just learning the subject of each class. I'm learning how to take notes better and how to approach real life problems with the tools I've learned in Psychology.",3,3
124,1298,"He told me that he'd wait for me. That I was worth it for him. He told me that I made him happy and that he could talk to me in ways that he's never been able to talk with another person before. I was so happy to have meant something to this person the way that he told me I did. 

I wanted to take things slow with him, my heart was already ripped up and starting to heal. I knew that my heart was filling up with him completely. We used to stay up late and just talk to each other until we fell asleep. I slept better at night. I hoped that he did, too. 

One night after we spent time talking like we did, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I asked him if he was formally asking and not just joking. He said he was. I said yes. 

Not even two weeks later he broke up with me. Because we both had other things to take care of. There was suddenly no room for me in his life. 

I'm still broken up about it. I still hurt. It hurts right now. Why promise me these things and then take them away? What did I do. Did I do wrong? He says I didn't. I don't believe him. 

I don't hate him.",3,3
125,1299,"My wife has been trying to convince me to start streaming on Twitch and I finally took the plunge a few months ago. Just this week out of nowhere I got a ton of new follows and went from being a small nobody stream to a not too small not quite a nobody stream with a couple hundred follows and an eighty viewer average. It was at this moment that I realized that maybe I actually could make streaming into something. Apparently people like to watch me once they discover me and find my brand of humor amusing. 

My wife is currently my only moderator but this also means she's watching my streams when I'm playing and we've grown closer because of the sheer amount of stupid twitch chat/streaming involves. Last weekend I got a donation from someone that touched me. In it they talked about how they'd been going through a rough time of their lives because their parents had gotten in a car wreck while they were on vacation. They had both lived but their father had gotten paralyzed. 

He'd been depressed since the accident since he'd always been an active man but now couldn't do that anymore. His father asked him what he was watching and he showed him the stream and they wound up watching me for the entire three hours I was streaming that night. His father's mood apparently improved and he even asked when the next time I'd be streaming is and asked his son if they could watch me together again. 

I'd never thought that doing something as silly as playing video-games and just talking with random people in my chat could help. I'm glad to find out I was mistaken though and even if it's just a guy and his father I'm happy to say it at least helped two people. 

My wife however is living the ""I told you so"" dream at this point and keeps rubbing in that I should have started sooner. Now if only my father was still around so I could join the ""I told you so"" bandwagon since he always said ""You can't make money playing video-games"".",3,3
126,13,"Born and raised in a beautiful home. Wonderful memories - they feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter night but also like they happened a lifetime ago. 

Moved to new country with family - didn't fit in (still don't). Underwhelming academics and no real friends. Spend years feeling like an outsider. 

Move back to home country for 18 months - first taste of love (and loss). Life is good. 

Move back to new country again - back to being alone. Spend years without real social connection. 

Enlist in army - fail out of basic and spend 2 years doing grunt work. 

Go to uni - experience a sense of connection for the first time in my life. Pick up smoking and drink more than ever before. Underwhelming academics - teetering on the edge of flunking out. 

Vow to make a change in 3rd year - let go of a wonderful woman for the wrong one. Get deeper into drinking - grasping at everything to feel accepted and happy. Grades pick up,feel more accepted, and fall deeper in love (with the wrong person). Feel alive but lost in my partner. 

Lose my identity and become a pleaser - feels better than the alternative. Make it through uni and move back home. 

Dad loses job, relationship on the rocks and feel alone without support. Life feels hopeless. Depression and anxiety worse than before. 

Find a well paying entry level job and relationship breaks down. Fight through the pain but let go of opportunities to connect with others. Isolation and self-preservation peppered with copious drinking become the way of life. 

Get promoted and make smart career choices - reach top .5% of earners in my country within 5 years post-uni. Quit smoking and start taking care of my health/diet. Quit drinking. 

Visit my ex-gf and realize it can never be the same. Corona hits and also start a new job that's deemed to be beyond ""what I should be able to secure"", and start casually dating. 

Get certified in skydiving, scuba diving and get my motorbike license (and a new bike). Get more confident and start meeting interesting people. Still feeling vulnerable and lonely. 

Get a beautiful puppy and watch him grow. Life starts getting better. Family gets closer and old wounds start to heal. The world suddenly seems more beautiful. The greys are less dull and colors are more vibrant. 

Slowly realize that no one can rescue me but myself - feel re-invigorated. Still searching for meaning but feeling hopeful and more at peace.

127,130,"Today was a very exciting and wonderful day! Although my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks, I really hadn't put much thought into it at all. I know Billy won't be here, and to be honest at my age birthdays don't really mean much anyway. 

So, here's what happened. We were all sitting down eating supper and Billy called. He talked to Veronica, who hung up the phone and told me something was going on and we were to meet him in the driveway. I put on my shoes, and followed her out to wait for him to arrive. 

After about 20 minutes, I heard what I thought was his motorcycle coming up the driveway. Sure enough, it was him. I was so concerned about what was going on I didn't even see what was happening right in front of my eyes. 

There he was, sitting on the bike right in front of me, grinning from ear to ear; It was MY bike!!! The one I had designed and was in the works for over 2 years!! I had no idea he had even been working on it and here it was, finished and in all its glory! It was gorgeous. Painting in black and my favorite shade of blue, lowered almost all the way to the ground, and sounding like a beast! Harley Davidson custom at it's finest! 

I was absolutely elated. Billy sat there with a shit-eating grin from one ear to the other, knowing he was a champion. He told me Happy Birthday, and that he loved me very much. He wanted me to have a very special birthday present this year because he wasn't going to be able to be here for my birthday, and felt terrible about it. 

I love this man! He is such a fantastic, loving, and supportive husband. To think he went out of his way to work so hard for weeks to get this project finished just to make me happy and see me smile. 

I am still very sad that he won't be here for my special day, but I have to admit he cushioned the blow a great deal with this fabulous surprise. I knew years ago he was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and I was right. He is my heart and my soul, and I can't imagine life without him. 

Happy birthday to me!",3,3
128,1300,"This event happened about two months back. I work from home so my home computer is my life line. Without it I simply couldn't get paid. 

Anyway two months ago my CPU suddenly just died. At first I had no idea what had went wrong, but apparently the cooling gel used to keep the CPU under extreme temps had mostly evaporated, so the CPU was overheating during my late night gaming sessions. 

At the point in time I didn't have enough money to buy a better CPU, I had just finished paying off a bunch of debt that I collected over the years. I pretty much thought I was screwed and maybe had to go out and get a temp job until I had enough money to replace my broken CPU. 

Anyway I had told my mom about it and I guess she told the family because a few days later my mom came over and handed me an envelope of money. At first I thought it was from her and I declined it, I didn't want to take my mother's hard earned money she got from working all those years. 

But she informed me a few of my brothers and sisters got together and pooled in money, enough that I could replace my CPU with a brand new powerful one. I'm not much of an emotional guy, at least in front of others. I try to always keep my cool and play it straight, but I couldn't help as the tears started to fall from my eyes. I was so grateful and thankful that people who loved and cared for me came through and went the extra mile for this. 

My family isn't rich, so I know them giving up their hard earned money to help me out was big. Not saying we're poor, but we're not rich enough where we can just give away money without a care in the world. 

My mom gave me a big hug and in that moment I felt the deepest amount of gratitude I ever experienced in my entire life. From the bottom of my heart I was truly deeply thankful. 

Later on I got together with my brothers and sisters that helped out, throwing them a party in their honor. It was the least I could do for such wonderful family members.",3,3
129,1302,"Well, I am a grandmother. I have a 30 year old son. He got married at 17, and I have an 11 year old granddaughter and a 2 year old grandson. My son's dad was Jewish, from Poland, but born in New York in 1966. He died of a brain tumor. 

My son, looks fine, but the kids were born with a brain cyst. Both had had a brain surgery to help them, but the cysts are still there. These cysts are affecting their lives, they have to go see the Doctor and check them. Just a week ago, my little grandson had a surgery again. I went to visit him in the Hospital, and he looked so delicate, so blue, and very, very pale. 

I am so worried about them, but other than that, when the cysts are not acting, they are healthy, normal, and very intelligent. I would say that they are geniuses. And happy. I just love them. 

They don't live with me, but they come visit. I love to play with my grandson, he is the one that plays with me. Last night, we were playing, and I showed him a chess box. We placed all the pieces in the board and we had fun with them. 

I am so happy he is doing well. He has to wear a helmet because his skull is so thin that one fall could be fatal. But in the last check up, the Dr. said his skull is getting better. Perhaps one day he will be able to be without the helmet. 

Right now, just seeing them alive is a miracle.",3,3
130,1303,"After my son was born in 2016, I lived with my parents for a couple years. I got married and my husband moved in with us, and we decided to have another baby in January of 2018. During that time, my Dad was diagnosed with early signs of dementia. It was a hard time for all of us. He was mostly bed ridden and having other complications as well. He survived skin cancer 2 different times and was missing part of his nose and mouth from it. 

He started to be very mean to my son at random times because of the dementia and it got very tough and stressful. We were ALL on edge about it. My husband who lived with us as well, decided that we were moving out because of it. 

When we told them the news, everyone got into an argument and it got VERY heated. It was mostly my husband that made the decision, so my parents took all the anger out on him. We moved out. And I was in very little to no contact with them. 

During that time, my Dad passed away from a heart attack. I would give anything to go back in time and tell him that I love him.",3,3
131,1304,"Today I went to meet another newborn. With flowers for mom and gift for baby in hand, I made my way through the hospital hallways, recalling the memories of the birth of my own baby, my now two year old and husband walking alongside me. 

In the past few months, the baby fever has overwhelmed me, made me giddy with excitement, and brought me to tears. After a very difficult and traumatic labor and delivery two years back, I never thought I would want another one so soon. But here I was walking in the hallways, past the nursery, the faint echo of brand-new baby cries lingering into my heart. 

It seemed like everyone near and dear to me was either pregnant, or just had a brand new baby, something I long for so bad. But I know, realistically, right now would not be the ideal time for cradles and bibs. That time, I know, is so close, but seemingly so far away. 

There are things that must be done to prepare; the unchecked list runs through my head every single day. My body needs to be 20-30 pounds lighter. We need to figure out a few financial things. I need to get my dentist work done first. I need to read all the books and do all the research. My husband, also with his own worries and fears, needs to be on the same page. 

Somehow my many ""needs"" have put my one major ""want"" on hold, and it's resulted in a sin called envy. I greet another tired mama, stare at another sweet sleeping babe, and hand in hand with my husband, walk out the door. 

We get into the car, and I let out a heavy, longing sigh. My husband, looks me straight in the eyes. ""What?"" I ask. He doesn't speak, just gives me a small smile. We speak to each other without speaking. I smile back as tears fall down my cheeks. 

I close my eyes and the list appears. Check. My heart is content.",3,3
132,1305,"I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option. I had found extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it. 

I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit. Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom. 

After I actually did this I felt empowered but by the next day I felt terrified because I had devoted 7 1/2 years to a job I had retired from. I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over. 

I had taken the kids to school and it was time for me to get online and work. This was almost 3 weeks ago. It has been a struggle so far and I'm learning how to navigate my time when it comes to working online, but it's been rewarding. 

This destination of happiness, while I realized it's a mood and not so much a destination, I have spent much more time feeling it. I've not only been able to take my kids to school, but I've actually been able to watch my 14 year old son's soccer games and haven't missed a baseball practice for my younger son and we've spent more time hiking and going to the dog park. 

I know it won't be easy but I am tired of living on auto pilot. For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling. 

I hope to find more work online because I need more income soon, but I feel as though things will work out for the best. Sometimes you have to choose yourself and actually live. This was my time and I'm proud to say I chose me.",3,3
133,1306,"It was three months ago that my dog ended up missing. My husband and I looked everywhere. We walked up and down many streets. Drove to different neighborhoods. But no sign of Peanut. It was horrible and distressing. Our daughter was so sad that, she couldn't even function in school. This affected all of us very deeply. Peanut was our bestfriend of 10 years. 

Then one day our daughter came home and told me that she had seen Peanut in a yard near her school. So we went there, and sure enough it was Peanut. He yelped and jumped up and down, he was so glad to see us. 

We knocked on the door of the mobile home. A man answered the door. The man there said he had dog for years. He told us to leave the property or he was going to call the police I said good, I hope you call them. 

When police arrived, one officer talked to us and the other talked to the man. I showed the officer pictures of Peanut on my phone, the ad I had posted in the lost and found in the local newspaper, and the flyers that I have printed and posted all over town. 

Both the officers talked among themselves. Then they talked to us. They said since the man doesn't have any proof of a vet bill, no pictures, no anything to prove otherwise, they said take your dog home and make sure he can't get loose again. 

I was happy with tears and my daughter was so happy, because the whole time Peanut was so excited to see us, it was obvious, he was our dog.",3,3
134,1307,"This has been one of the hardest days of my life. I lost my little friend, Prance. I should start by saying that Prance was a rescue dog. Prance came from a local shelter. Prance was 3 years old when I got him. The day, April 17, that I got Prance was exactly a year to the day that I had lost another dog, Butch. Like Butch, Prance was a Schnauzer. 

I woke up that morning and just had a strong desire to go to the animal shelter. And there was Prance. From the first moment, we bonded, and he was like my little grey shadow. April 17th 2019, I treated the day like it was Prance's birthday, since his actual birth date was unknown. He had turned 12. 

Prance had always been a very picky eater and he had started refusing his food. On the 4th day of not eating, I took Prance to the vet. Prance had pancreatitis and had to be hospitalized. When Prance came home, he was refusing to eat again. Prance began to get very weak and had difficulty standing up. He was now at a point where he could not walk at all. 

Prance was laying next to me, as he always was, while I watched TV. Prance suddenly reached out his paw to me 3 times, like he would do when he wanted to get some attention. I picked Prance up and held him. Prance began to tremble and shake. He took a couple of deep breathes and went limp in my arms. 

I feel like Prance reached out to me to say goodbye, and I am happy that I was there for him in his last moment of life.",3,3
135,1308,"About two weeks ago, my boyfriend's grandmother passed away. Her critical health condition did not surprise anyone as her health had been declining for months. On top of that she had dementia from mid stage Alzheimer's so she really didn't remember much of anything. 

The day she was admitted to the hospital she collapsed in her room at the nursing home. They rushed her to the hospital. The doctors said that she shattered the bone in her shoulder. They needed to operate on her. However, they knew that she probably wouldn't survive the surgery due to her fragile condition. They told us that she probably wouldn't live much longer. We should expect the worst. They fed her a steady supply of pain medications while we watched unable to do anything. 

My boyfriend, his family, and myself returned home to think about what happened. At four in the morning they called us to inform us that her heartbeat was getting fainter. We should return to the hospital if we wanted to say goodbye. So we all left gathering around her. As we said our goodbyes, she passed away. We all stood around crying. My boyfriend's uncle would be arriving shortly to check up on us. We went home afterwards and sat in silence. 

I found the whole thing depressing. Everyone else seemed to take it better than me. They told me that the person they knew and loved died a long time ago. She would continue to decline due to her dementia. At least she was able to pass before she progressed into late stage Alzheimer's. 

Regardless, it impacted me. My boyfriend hugged me as his mother cooked breakfast.",3,3
136,1309,"It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult. I NEVER would have seen this coming when I was just an innocent kid who used to go Down South each summer and stay with her over other nearby relatives because she was so kind to me. 

Although it's been decades, I remember her taking me to the movies, amusement parks and our annual family reunion barbecue. This was before her child was born, so it was just me and her for the most part when we weren't out and about. Those were the days -- miss 'em indeed. 

Now her child is grown and she looks like an anorexic, bug-eyed, stressed-out version of her old dour, well-fed self. She has literally lost dozens of pounds and is so skinny, the entire family is afraid severe weight loss will end her before any other medical problem can. 

I first found out about the cult she joined from relatives who, unlike me, talk to her fairly regularly. We went to see her in person this summer because of increasing concerns about her state of mind, and were we in for a shock. Her formerly well-kept home, which she has owned for years, was a complete mess, like a hurricane flew through it several times over. 

SHE was a complete mess, too. It was so sad to see her but not recognize the random ramblings about her new group of ""friends."" Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of them, so there were no confrontations with the people dragging her down. 

Our only hope is that eventually we will be able to stage a successful intervention to help her reclaim her life. I hope and wish with all my heart that we will not be too late.",3,3
137,131,"My fourth son was born three months ago. My family and I went to an annual summer party that my neighbor throws. We got home around 9:00 pm and my wife was having some pains. We did not think anything of it as she had been having these pains for the last three weeks. 

But around 1:00 am the next day her water broke while we were sleeping. We called my in-laws to watch our kids and took her straight to the hospital. She was quickly admitted and taken to a room to deliver our son. 

We expected a quick labor as it was her fourth child, however it took nearly nineteen hours before he was born. The issue it turns out was he had his umbilical cord wrapped around his body, making it difficult for him to come out. 

Luckily, he was born healthy and without any complications. We spent the next two days in the hospital. Nurses and doctors came in and out to check on him and run tests throughout our stay. 

It was a surreal experience and even though I already had been through it three times it was a whirlwind of emotion. It was one of the best days of my life being able to witness the birth on my child. It is something I will never forget for the rest of my life.",3,3
138,1310,"Today I would like to write about deciding to quit my job. It was a decision I debated and sat on for a while to be honest. I had been thinking about it so much and had been waiting for the right sign and when I finally got it, I just kind of acted on impulse. I went home that night and decided to just never return. 

Now, yes, I hated my job, but like everyone else in America I was there because I kind of needed it. But what was the value in that? What was I worth to myself? Willingly signing up to deal with bullshit and be stressed out every single day was affecting who exactly the most? And to make matters worse, I found out they were stealing money from me after I was practically their best employee. So yeah, I had to quit. It was pretty much the only choice I was left with. 

Things have not always been the best since I have quit either. Please do not get me wrong. I often wonder if doing that was the smartest possible choice I could make. But I can always find solace in the fact that I take care of myself first. And knowing that is all I need to sleep like a baby at night.",3,3
139,1312,"Today was a very good Sunday. I was invited to lead the music at a joint church service at a church I've never been to before. A church in a city a bit far off, they asked if I could lead their music. I was floored by the invitation. The pastor of that asked for me specifically. He had visited my church a couple of times before and saw how we run our music for our liturgy. 

As the leader of my church's music, I only expected to lead music for my church. I never really had thoughts of leading other churches in the near future. Then a couple weeks before this day, my pastor told me that the pastor of another church we will be joining services with asked me to lead their music for our joint service. I was initially in shock, but jumped at the chance to serve where I was able. 

After I finished leading music at the church, I felt great and more sure of my abilities. The church members were very thankful for my services and enjoyed the all a'cappella approach I institute at my own church. They told me how they enjoyed just hearing voices to sing hymns and how much more participation the congregation there was than before. 

I am very grateful for the opportunity I was given and how blessed myself and others were in the service I was able to give. I hope I get opportunities like this again, but to remember that it is all for the glory of God and not myself.",2,2
140,1313,"On July 9, 2019 I moving in with my Celia. This is kinda weird, because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/ accessories. Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally. 

It is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity. I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it. Their contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible. The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. 

It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice. It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone. It is midday and it is hot up here. That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room. The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her. Just energy of joy is bounding through my body. 

Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away. Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing. It was great though, because it was her way of going out of her way to make this a great first day. Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into. 

Finding a good groove to sit in felt like I was making a long term investment. While she laid under my arm it placed over her like a puzzle piece fitting in. It feels like the right decision and that this is going to be a positive experience no matter how it ends.",3,3
141,1314,"I got up early that morning and took a shower then got dressed. I proceeded to go into the kitchen made my lunch then fed my cats and off I went to the office. Traffic was very bad that morning stop and go. As I sat in traffic I got so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. The longer I stayed in traffic the worse I felt,, I couldn't keep my eyes open. 

I finally got a block from my office and came to a stop light and don't remember going through the red light and hitting another car. After I hit the car of course my air bag went off and knocked the air out of me leaving me having a hard time breathing. I then heard the sound of an ambulance approaching. Two medic got out and tried to get me out of my car but the could't because my leg was badly messed up and bleeding. 

Needless to say I broke my ankle and had to have pins put in it plus a compound fracture of my leg and all my ribs on my right side broken. I stayed in the hospital for about two weeks and had a lot of physical therapy. This happened about six months ago and I am still having a little trouble walking but little by little I'm getting better. 

The accident was indeed my fault, I'm so glad the other person did not have any injuries . I since learned I have sleep- apnea and that is why I fell asleep at the wheel. I worry about driving and at times very nervous but with time I know things will get better. 

I had to drive with my son to get the courage to drive again and even then I was very nervous and shaky . You never know what will happen when you leave home to go to work so always try to be prepared.",3,3
142,1315,"I've been struggling a bit lately financially. I'm not making the same money I was making at my job, and things are really tight for me right now. I had a flat tire on my car, and I changed it and put the donut tire on. I cant afford to buy a new tire right now. The donut tire has a slow leak though, and I was always putting air in it. The whole situation just has me down and depressed. 

I work with a good friend of mine. We are close and have been friends for a long time. She knows I have been struggling with things. She asked me one day if she could use my car on her lunch break to run a couple errands. Her husband had dropped her off that day because her car was getting an oil change. I told her sure and gave her the keys. 

She came back to work after her lunch and gave me my keys and we went about our day. I left work that day and went out to my car. Something was different on it, and it took me a minute to realize that my donut tire was gone, and there was a brand new tire on my car. I stood there dumbfounded thinking ""how did this happen?"" and I called my friend and asked her if she knew anything about. 

She laughed, and told me ""Happy Birthday"" that she had bought me a new tire for my car for my Birthday that was coming. I was so surprised and touched, that I burst into tears. She is an amazing friend, and I am blessed to have her in my life!",3,3
143,1316,"Leah, my 4 year old, began pre-school. I was already a nervous wreck, because she and I had to get up early to go see my oldest daughter do her ""Senior Walk"", where all of the seniors walk into school on the first day behind their principal and all of us parents are on the sides cheering and yelling and crying and it is over in 5 minutes. I was worried about Leah having to get up early and us driving to the high school, finding a parking spot and then getting back to her school and having her into her classroom on time. We had no problem getting back to her school in time. 

My plan was to park and walk my little girl to her class, but on the car ride over, she declared that she wanted to be dropped off and walk into the school by herself, because she was a big girl. I was sad. When we got to her school, and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs and they walked her into the building. I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. 

She is my miracle baby and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been her and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house and I miss her. I miss having her eat lunch with me and I walked into the mall without her and felt like someone was going to ask me for id when I walked into the kids section of a store. I didn't get begged to go into Build a Bear or get a Frappucino from Starbucks and have to wait for her to jump on all of the squares in the tile flooring. 

She is adjusting well to her new school schedule and I have time to watch stupid shows like 90 Day Fiance. I guess I will make it, it will be starting all over with her, and I am scared, but she thinks she is ready, and that is more of what matters.",3,3
144,1318,"On August 19, 2019, I went to see my new neurologist concerning my MS. I have had MS for many years but over the last 10 years or so, I moved from relapsing remitting to secondary progressive. I have been having a lot of problems with falling and stumbling and the fatigue has been horrible. To further complicate the issue I fell on April 2nd this year and tore up my knee, which exacerbated the MS. 

I started back to work the first day of school, August 14th. I substitute in high needs SPED. I knew I wasn't doing well with my MS, but it came as a complete shock to me when my doctor told me I was ""running out of reserves/ basically about out of reserves"" and I need to conserve my energy NOW. 

She said I should not be working, which I love my students, but she understood why I continued. Now, I am having to cut back my days at school and have accepted the fact that this year will be last year of teaching, I want to use my energy for doing the other things I love, which is travelling. I am going to Italy in September and will have to go on a rollator/wheelchair. 

I am devastated, I have been bursting into tears, even at school, I am having problems coping with this new news. It's almost like when I was first diagnosed, but worse now because of my age. I have always ""pushed through"" and tried to exercise my legs. I have been told I should really STOP now to reserve whatever I have left. 

I am using my walker at home now, so that is helping with my falling. However, because I used to be paralyzed from my waist down and spent years on my scooter, I do not want to have to use a scooter again. I donated both of mine. I also had hand controls in my vehicle, which I am afraid I might have to do again. I am okay with that aid. 

I simply feel like I am going backwards, even though I have known for the 34 years I've had MS it is a progressive disease. Now that my husband is retired and we can do things, it is so difficult for me, though I thoroughly enjoy travelling. 

This new news about my MS has been emotionally and mentally exhausting.",3,3
145,1319,"I'm from Tampa, Florida, but this past Summer, I decided to call Nantucket Island home. It's an entire 2600 miles away and I've, quite literally, never moved out of the state of Florida even though I've traveled plenty. Even though I'm thirty three years old, it doesn't stop my parents from worrying and missing me every day. 

It just so happens that this year my Mother was turning fifty back in June. I made the arrangements to fly home and throw her a surprise party with my sister-in-law. It was a whirlwind trip but it was definitely worth it! 

My Mom isn't much for being the center of attention or professing her emotions beyond what is necessary. In fact, it is quite possible I've seen my Dad cry more than I have seen her cry. That is saying a lot! 

At her birthday party, she was clearly very surprised when she arrived. There were easily a hundred people in attendance. The greatest moment of all, though, was when her eyes finally landed on me. She started CRYING and then she started laughing and then she cried some more. Her legs just about gave out from underneath her. 

To make things even better, it was all caught on tape! I will never, for the rest of my life, forget that moment. It is one of my very favorite memories.",3,3
146,132,"Back in May I finally mustered up the courage to go on a fast to improve my rapidly deteriorating health. I knew this was necessary to completely reset my immune system and also to improve my mindset and bring me back down to earth. My drinking and eating habits had been spinning out of control and experience has taught me that this was the best solution. I succeeded for 11 days! Very proud of myself, I tried to ease my way back into some semblance of a life. 

One morning I woke up so restless and energetic that I decided it was time to revisit one of my favorite haunts: a place called Town Square. There I knew that I could get a quality lunch with good company and a nice glass of rose wine. I also needed to do some shopping and figured I could grab a snack and catch a movie; something I hadn't done in a long time. 

The problem arose, however, as soon as I arrived. Suffering already from fatigue having had to wait in the increasing heat for a bus, shopping was a bit difficult. I found respite in the changing rooms. I was able to purchase the items I wanted, however, and proceeded to the bar to dine! Two lovely fish tacos, the special of the day which included the glass of wine all for only $12. I was very proud of myself. 

But here I hesitated. I knew that eating would make me tired and thought maybe I should just Uber it home and catch a movie online somewhere. But no, stubborn me persisted in going to the movie theater. The heat was vicious by this early afternoon hour. I barely was able to drag myself to the theater and certainly some people thought I was drunk! How embarrassing! I finally had to call a friend to come pick me up. Four hours later I made it home. What a horrible day....",3,3
147,1320,"My husband and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary. It is emotional for me, because we've been together for eleven years so celebrating an anniversary with someone I love so much makes me happy. A lot of people don't last in relationships, and to have a long lasting relationship and a great one makes me very happy. 

My husband surprised me on our anniversary by taking me to the resort that we got married at. It was a very special seafood dinner buffet. it was fancy, and when we go out to eat we usually don't eat out at places so fancy, so it was very special. 

I have cherished the time i spent with my husband. We have gone on lots of fun trips together. We have moved cross country twice. My relationship is a very memorable part of my life. it feels very special to get to spend my life with someone. 

The most memorable part of this year as well is that my English Bulldog celebrated one year of not having aspiration pneumonia. She was very sick a year ago and almost died. She is very important to me and my husband. She makes us both very happy, and adds to the joy of our relationship.",3,3
148,1321,"Two months ago my partner and I went on vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada. The beginning was rough as we had two to three hours delay with our flight. I was supposed to arrive at 8:00 pm local time but ended up reaching there around 10:30 pm. We had problems with our transportation to our hotel. There was a misunderstanding with driver, took us to the wrong hotel. Finally, at 11:15 pm we reached our hotel. 

We were tired so could do nothing except going to bed. However, next morning we were amazed by the layout of casinos in the hotel; there were hundreds. After having breakfast, we set out to observe the sin city. There were people everywhere. We were thrilled to see amazing structures such the water show at one of the hotels. 

We walked all day observing hotels and casinos and trying out various drinks. The night time was even more amazing with music and songs being played. There was a memorable volcanic eruption show at a hotel next to ours. 

The next day we took a tour bus and traveled to various parts of the city. It was very exhilarating. We had a great time in Las Vegas and going cherish it for a long time.",2,2
149,1322,"About two weeks ago I adopted a new cat. I go to a local pet store once a week or once every two weeks to buy supplies for my animals. I often take my husband to the pet store with me so that he can carry the heavier items that I purchase. 

At the back of the pet store there is a small room that has a big window so people can see in. Inside the room are several cages where cats are kept that are available for adoption. Several months ago, my husband noticed an orange cat with the name Ivan in one of the cages and he seemed to really like him. 

Week after week I would go to the pet store and pass by this room. I could not help but notice that while many of the other cages were filled with different cats each week, Ivan never moved. He just sat in his small cage waiting to be adopted. The store lowered his adoption fee several times but, still no one wanted Ivan. It made me very sad to see him sitting there so, on the next trip to the pet store, I took my husband again. 

I showed him that Ivan was still there and asked an employee to let him meet the lonely cat. It was instant love. Ivan almost jumped into my husbands arms and purred. It was like he knew they were going to be together. I signed some paperwork and bought a few new toys while they got acquainted. 

My husbands eyes lit up when I came back with a box to take Ivan home in. When we got home, Ivan seemed comfortable like he had always been there.",2,2
150,1323,"A few weeks ago, I had dinner with two of my close friends from high school, Victoria and Tammy. We get together about four times a year to catch up and see how we are all doing. Tammy's life is always full of drama and crazy events because of her relationship with her boyfriend Anthony. She caught us up about all of their fighting, issues, and his crazy family. As usual I gave her my opnion on her horrible situation and I explained to her why they are so toxic to each other. 

After we were done hanging out, Tammy gave Victoria a ride home. On the way, Tammy made comments to Victoria that she hated my input and that is why she did not tell me anything. Fast forward to a few weeks later, I get a call in the middle of the night. It was Tammy and I let it go to voicemail 3 times before finally answering. 

Anthony got arrested and she needed bail money or the title to my car. In that moment I realized how toxic she is. I began to question so many things about our friendship and her situation. How can someone not want to hear your advice and opnion but still call you for bail money? How does one get into a sitaution where they do not have $500 in their savings? 

I realized that Tammy is not the type of person I want in my life. If someone is not making your life better then it is better to just go seperate ways.",2,2
151,1326,"We have new neighbors, right next door. I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established. I own my home. I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. 

The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. 

The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, nunchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. 

I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe. Two houses left phone numbers. 

After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. 

I felt very supported, as an individual, as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born. 

When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied. 

It reminds me of why I have felt so comfortable and welcome here.",3,3
152,1329,"This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. 

However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. 

It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. 

After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",3,3
153,133,"I was emotionally touched when a person I know was able to successfully complete a year in high school band and orchestra. He had been taking lessons since he was four years old on piano and then started several other instruments in the first grade. He practiced his heart out each day for up to an hour or more for years and took private lessons as well as lessons at school. 

Difficulty arose when he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started suffering from delusions at the young age of only nine. His mind gave him difficulty concentrating to say the least. He had periods of wellness and periods of struggle and fights in his brain over what was reality and was wasn't. 

The years went by with many changes in medications and suffering on his part due to the side effects of his medications. I didn't know if he would be able to make it to participate in such a challenging endeavor. He works so hard, but his mind is constantly giving him a fight. 

He went into the school year optimistic and fully devoted to doing his best. The year pressed on and he pressed on as well practicing and attending doctor's visits to keep him well. He had some bounces up and down with medication adjustments needed. He kept fighting the fight and practicing. He played when he could and took a rest break in the halls when needed. 

Others didn't see the struggles except in his section of the band occasionally they would see a tear come from his eyes before he had to take a break in the hall. His struggles were mostly hidden except to me who could observe his pain and sorrow even though he didn't even know what was causing it. 

Bipolar is a hidden illness because you have to keep it hidden to stay afloat in the real world. It causes symptoms that aren't even understood by the person experiencing them. Sadness comes without any warning or preceding events. Sometimes silliness comes without even anything to joke about. It is odd, but can stop you in your tracks. 

I was so proud when he performed in his concerts at the end of the year, because he made it another year fighting the fight to pursue his dreams.",3,3
154,1330,"I recently found out that one of my best friends was badmouthing me to my fiancee because he had a thing for her. He was telling her all sorts of lies to sway her into thinking I'm a bad guy in efforts to win her over. Fortunately, she told me and I was really mad because I was being betrayed by someone I trusted. I forgave him in my heart but I can't be friends with him anymore. I just can't bring myself to trusting him and considering him my friend anymore. 

What's sad is that he's put my life out of balance now because I don't trust anyone anymore because of that betrayal. That being said, I was happy that my fiancee trusted me enough to alert me about it and get my side before believing anything that friend was telling her. I appreciate her now more than ever and know that whatever life throws at us we'll get through it if we trust each other enough to communicate about everything, good or bad. 

This event helped me learn a few important lessons. One is that we get betrayed by the people we trust most. Second is that communication is key to success in a relationship.",3,3
155,1332,"So we have been friends since about June/July. I was in my first relationship when I met her and only liked her as a friend. That relationship didnt last longer than a month and I'm all over it. But as time went on we became best friends. 

During this September we've started hanging out a lot more. Most of the time that we hang out we smoke weed and go on walks, we also have deep and meaningful conversations all of the time. I've been at her house two times and she has been at my house once. We have so much fun together and her smile feels like rays of sun spreading happiness inside of me. 

She has told me how much she enjoys spending time with me compared to other people, when I asked her what she meant with that she didn't really expand on it. Our personalities go together perfectly and I really enjoy spending time with her. 

I've expressed to her how much I like her as a friend and she's told me the same thing. This Monday I slept at her house after we had spent all afternoon hanging out together after school. We cuddled and she came closer to me and I'll just give some examples of interactions that night. I told her that my hand was cold since the window was open and she asked me if I wanted to put my hand inside the back of her hoodie. I proceeded and the scratched her back while we watched a movie. 

She crept up close to me at night when we were done watching the movie and she put her head on my chest/shoulder. I started scratching her scalp and playing with her hair which I guess she liked. There was more stuff like this such as her grabbing my hand and I hugging her while we slept at night. Her pulling my arm up and around her neck and using it as a pillow. 

Thing is she is talking to another guy but she has told me that she isn't sure if she likes him. And Iask her about it saying stuff like how's it going with him and she doesn't really respond to that. 

I don't want to do anything stupid and ruin a fantastic friendship. I now have feelings for her after that night of her showing me affection and cuddling with her. I got to know her better and she's a fantastic woman with a bunch of cool theories and ideas about philosophy, media, and music.",3,3
156,1337,"I have been doing housework for about 45 years of my adult life and it has to be the most boring, repetitive, thankless and futile activity that anyone can engage in. I loathe it with a passion and always have and so I have decided to go on permanent strike. I don't like filth so I will keep that under control, but, as for sweeping, dusting, folding, ironing, polishing, vacuuming, scrubbing and all that jazz - I'm out! 

Since I mostly live alone it is my own mess and I couldn't give two hoots about what anyone else thinks about the state of my home anymore. I just want to spend my time doing things I enjoy without the daily interruptions of housework. I am liberating myself from this prison that is largely done for the benefit of what others think. I'm free. Woo hoo! 

Does anyone else feel the same way? If you do, just pack it in. Simple as that. If you live with others who can't take the fact that you no longer clean up after them, let them do it if they're old enough. It's just not fair that this horrendous task should become the default responsibility of one person in a household as it so often does. 

Time to give housework a last goodbye! Don't chew me up. Every family is different. This is just my story and it won't be the same for everyone. I'm just putting it out there because it is where I'm at right now.",3,3
157,1339,"I am a digital freelancer, and several years ago I built an online store for my mum's business. She is very old school so I handled the digital stuff and eventually helped her build a 7 figure store on top of my normal day job. She is now wanting to retire and is in the process of final exchanges of contract with a buyer, and the money is going to help her and my dad retire comfortably. 

So it sounds like a great story, but now that it's wrapping up I've stepped back and have seen with fresh eyes all the things I didn't do well, or things I didn't do at all - it's so strange how I didn't see it at the time - a kind of work/family blur that I can't explain. The success of the business kind of snowballed far beyond what we really set out for the business to be, and it reached a point where my mum was too old and old school to take it to the next step and where I didn't have the time (even convincing her to use social media was hard let alone using robotic fulfilment warehouses etc). 

Although I was being partially compensated at the end, I had my own clients to deal with, and after I tried to get several other freelancers on board and it didn't work out, I just did what I could with what time I had. But with the pandemic the whole thing exploded at the same time that I went through two extremely tragic personal losses, and in hindsight I should have just delegated tasks and let the business flourish and should have been less protective. 

It's true that my parents can retire comfortably because of me, but it's also true that they didn't have a lot more success because of me. I find it very hard to hold this two truths together and I'm scared I'll always think of it and always regret it.",3,3
158,1343,"So right now at this point in time there are 3 of us. My friend Matthew, my brother Jayden and Me. Why I think I'm the least favourite is because I often find them saying something and when I'm about to respond, I see that they're looking at each other, not me. 

We also play basketball and we are pretty good together as a trio. But I do think they have better chemistry as well when it comes to basketball. Plus they're both better looking than me, as much as I hate to say it, its true. So just that fact makes me feel lesser than them. 

I'm also an extrovert and they're more so on the introverted side. I feel like when they ask me things I can go on and on and on and on without really knowing. When I catch myself drowning them in my opinion I then have to stop and realise how annoying I really am. 

I hate it because its natural, I dont know how to change the fact that I'm more of a talker than a listener. Plus I laugh a lot and make jokes a bit too much sometimes out of boredom, nervousness or just wanting to fit in. 

I pray that one day I'll be better looking and have a much more interesting, listening type of personality.",3,3
159,1345,"I don't know if this is the norm for everyone but my social circle would usually avoid talking about financial situations. And I didn't mind that until recently. I'm still a university student while most of my friends have graduated and are working full-time. I'm paying for my own tuition and trying to get a Master degree (those aren't cheap). My waitress salary isn't the best but it covers the basic necessities with a little bit to put into savings. 

My friend would usually invite to me to go out in fancy and expensive places, which I could afford once or twice but not very often. Unfortunately, sometimes I couldn't find an excuse to get out and went with it and everytime it left me drained and more stressed afterwards due to the amount of money I have wasted. 

But ever since I started my new course I've had quite a tight budget so I try to save as much as I could. I'm not struggling to make ends meet but I still need to be smart with money in order to make it through university. So I would decline those hangouts and stated my intentions early on that I can't afford it. 

My friend would usually brush it off as quickly as she could the moment I talked about it and somehow still insist on me going (Like I didn't say I can't afford it 2 sentences ago). Only until recently I've been informed that some don't like to talk about money as it is a sensitive topic which I have to disagree. 

I'm not begging for their pity, I don't need them to sympathize with me, I only need them to understand my limits and boundaries as we all have different circumstances. Financial struggles isn't something to be ashamed about and it should be discussed between interpersonal relationships.",2,2
160,1346,"I'll be 21 this year and it just so turns out that I haven't done anything romantic in my life. Part of it is being kind of ehh in the looks department, and part of it is being shy and not having a lot of opportunities. I don't really put myself out there. 

I got asked out once by one of my friends in high school and I wasn't interested so I politely told him no and he accepted and we've stayed friends. 

Sometimes when people are talking about their relationships and romance stuff they want to hear me talk about it and I tell them that I've never done anything like the closest I had was getting asked out once and they act so confused like they can't believe I'm almost 21 and have never been on a date. 

I've had people straight up think im lying. Other times they'll talk to me in private about it and be like ""Wait you actually haven't had your first kiss yet? You're not lying?"" No, I'm seriously not lying. Why would I lie about THAT? Wouldn't it make more sense for me to lie about having dated because it's seen as weird to not have at 21? 

For the record, I do want to one day be in a relationship, but so far maybe I'm just not relationship material.",2,2
161,1349,"My dad was the kind of person whose only 2 goals in life were to have fun and to make others have fun. But now he's been gone for almost 5 years and everyone's still in the 'let's be sad and only gather together to cry about his tragically short life' phase. 

Whenever I try to make jokes, even to people who weren't even affected by his death, usually all I get is awkward smiles and worried looks, some even go as far as saying it was inappropriate. And there are the ones who laugh but say 'oh my god, I shouldn't laugh at this'. 

I know that if he was able to do so, he'd be the one making these jokes about his death. He wouldn't want to see us being sad, because of him, of all people. While he was alive, he was the one who would've moved mountains if that was what we needed to make us smile. Why do they think this changed in his death? 

And even if he was the sourest, most serious and least fun person in the world, I should be allowed to grieve him how I want to. Grief shouldn't be about the deceased person but about the ones they left behind.",3,3
162,135,"One morning in early July of this year I woke up around 4 in the morning and began tossing and turning. This is quite normal for me. As most nights in the summer I sleep on my couch in the living room because that room has the best air conditioner. As I was tossing and turning I was woken up by what I first thought was a really severe menstrual cramp. I tossed and turned and laid in the fetal position. The pain became unbearable and I decided I needed to get up. I was barely able to walk to the kitchen. I took a 500mg pain reliever and several tums. I still wasn't sure at this point what kind of pain this was. I just knew my lower stomach was in the worst pain I have ever felt. 

I tried to go back to sleep, but was unable to. Suddenly a wave of nausea hit me and I sprinted to my bathroom to throw up. I ended up throwing up twice and realized something was seriously wrong. I ended up asking my dad to bring me to the emergency room around 6am in the morning. 

They immediately brought me in and got me hooked up to an IV. Based on my symptoms alone they couldn't figure out what was wrong so they did a CAT scan of my stomach and it turns out my appendix was inflamed. My appendix was in danger of rupturing at any moment due to how inflamed it was and needed to be removed immediately. 

Within 30 minutes of this finding I was undergoing surgery to get my appendix removed. Had I not gone to the hospital when I did my appendix would have ruptured.",3,3
163,1352,"Today an Instagram scammer pretending to be someone else decided to target me. They were obviously a scammer, but I was bored and decided I wanted to have a chat with the scammer so I pretended to fall for it and entered a video call with them. I was fully aware that they were going to record it, but I was curious to see what they would threaten to do with it. 

When they revealed themselves they decided to threaten to show it to everyone I follow (Which is fine by mean since I doubt any of them would care all too much, and maybe even find it funny), unless I gave them 7000. I told them I only had 200, expecting them to negotiate, but apparently they are stupid enough to expect someone to even consider paying the initial amount. 

After that, I proceded to give them tips on how to scam more convincingly, and then said I'd pay them 100 for photos of them. During this, he got increasingly angry and kept screaming until he left without making more attempts to get money. 

Overall it was pretty funny and seemed mostly risk-free, I have no idea if they followed up on the threats yet though.",2,2
164,1355,"I work remotely, and I'm an extrovert who loves people watching. As such, a couple of times a week I go to the mall and sit at the Starbucks near me. Today, a stranger walked in and ordered their drink and sat down at their table. The place was super busy so I never gave it a second thought, however the way this person was sitting looked a bit odd. 

I looked at them a little closer (in a non-obvious way) and noticed that they were covering their face with their hands and were desperately trying to hold back tears. I felt terrible for this person and after thinking about it for a few minutes, I decided I'd get them a doughnut or a cookie or something to try and cheer them up. 

So I got up and went to another shop, and while I was there I wrote on a piece of paper: ""Hey, I noticed that you don't seem okay. Whatever it is that's bothering you, I hope it gets better and you feel better soon. Here's a cookie, hopefully it helps you feel better! P.S Sorry if this is awkward. 

Well just as I went back to Starbucks to try and give it to them, they were gone. At some point between me thinking I should do something and actually doing it, they got up and left. I feel so terrible right now. I feel so bad for that person, I don't know what they were going through but it didn't look like it was good. 

If only I had acted a bit quicker I might have been able to make a difference, no matter how small. I feel really heartbroken. I just hope they're okay wherever they are and that they feel better soon.",3,3
165,1356,"So just an hour ago I received a notification from my school that my class will start our new semester today and we'll have to study online. Doesn't sound bad at all until I remembered that the school staff told us way back in August (when the last semester ended) that the new semester wouldn't begin until November, and that we'd go to school as normal. 

After reading this I was terrified, like full on panicked. I began refreshing the facebook page where I received the news over and over again, went to recheck my emails multiple time, digging up old notifications to see if there were any mistakes. There weren't so I went back and saw that our class was full of students, and then it clicked. 

You see, the reason I had to wait for a few months to continued studying in the first place was because too many people had dropped out of my class, and the school had to close it until more people has joined. The moment we had enough students for the class again, they reopened it and didn't inform anyone until the very last minute. 

But knowing this didn't help me calm down at all, instead I just got more panicked. I know I shouldn't be worrying over such an unwanted but ultimately minor surprise, but I just can't stop.",3,3
166,1357,"I was at the checkout this morning, waiting behind a mom and her 4/5 year old daughter. She had a cart full of Halloween decorations. Cutesy things like plush pumpkins and wreaths and scarecrows. The mom was at the end of the counter sorting out her reusable shopping bags. 

The child was unloading the cart. She was just jumping with excitement. The level in the cart got so low that the kid couldn't reach over the edge. So she did what any kid would do. She climbed the side. The cart started to tip, so I reached out to steady it. 

I guess Mom caught my movement out of the corner of her eye, because she whipped around, grabbed the kid, and started scolding her. Which, understandable. I startled her and her kid scared her. She stands the kid on the ground and starts emptying the cart. 

And this is where it starts to go off the rails.....The kid is watching with such a look of longing on her face. It was pitiful. The mom completely ignores her. Like she's not even there. Now, me. I would've done one of two or three things. I would've braced that cart with my feet and invited her to climb on up and have at it. Or picked the kid up and put her in the cart so she could hand things out. Or, at the very least, handed the things from the cart to the kid to put on the counter. 

So, when the mom turns towards the cashier, the kid starts climbing the cart again. Mom catches her again and scolds more harshly. Now the kid is standing there, staring at the floor, trying not to cry. Mom is doing the ignoring thing again. I'm trying not to notice. 

Then, the thing that absolutely burned my bacon...Last thing mom picked up out of the cart is this gorgeous child's Halloween mask. It's got fake painted lashes and adorable makeup and is trimmed around the edges with fluffy little feathers. Mom holds it in her hand, looks at the kid and says, ""You didn't really want this anyway, did you?"" In this bored, mean girl kind of voice. 

And the kid just looks at the mask. Follows with her eyes as mom puts it back on the shelf. I've never wanted to slap someone so much in my life. Poor kid.",3,3
167,1359,"I'm in a three piece psych rock band and we've finally been going out and playing shows locally. However, a friend of ours who's been supportive of us keeps mentioning to me that he started learning bass recently and is interested in playing for us. To be honest, I'm pretty happy with our line up right now and I'm not really looking to recruit more people than we need. I appreciate his enthusiasm but it always irks me that some people who have little to no experience try to invite themselves in the band especially when we never asked them to join in the first place. 

I've had this happen a few times over the years and it's always uncomfortable to deal with. I just really don't want to have to take time out of our rehearsals to make sure this guy is up to speed and having to help him along the way. We need experienced people who know what they're doing. I've been playing guitar/bass for 10 plus years and didn't even start playing in bands until 3 years ago. I don't know how he expects to keep up considering he just started learning a few months ago. 

Maybe I'm just way too polite but I don't know how to break it to this guy without coming across as rude or mean. When he's asked me about coming to rehearsals or learning songs I'll give something along the lines of a maybe which probably doesn't help the situation much.",2,2
168,136,"I recall meeting my most recent ex boyfriend on campus. There is a bar i would frequent often and would see him, sometimes he would buy me drinks, but my focus was not on dating. Eventually, we grew close and every time I went to the bar he would meet me there. it was always a great time. 

As most women do, i fell in love first. It was hard not to when I was spending every night and morning with him. I knew things were meant to be casual, but couldn't help how I started to feel. He began to cancel on me often and give other subtle signs that his feet were getting cold. 

I chose to ghost him in an effort to protect myself and my heart, but I still miss and long for him so much. As time goes on, it gets easier. However he will always have a place in my memory and my heart. 

I believe that he was a lesson. A lesson that love is often unexpected. A lesson also, that love can be even better than what we experience. While I enjoyed many qualities about him, I also know that I will not tolerate some things ever again as a result of our intense but short relationship.",3,3
169,1363,"So I work for a cleaning company and clean buildings by myself no biggie. I enjoy being by myself anyways. He lives three hours away. I put in my two weeks notice Friday. He messaged me today on Sunday. He always ghosts me, takes days to respond to me, and it's just unprofessional. He wanted me to ask around and see if anyone would be interested so I made a social media post and got responses immediately and gave him his number. He messaged me a minute ago over something different and I casually asked him if he got any messages for the position. He responded ""yes but I'm not working I'm off today of course"". 

Yeah I know he's off and I'm supposed to be off too, but here I am dealing with people interested, pointing them his way, and pretty much doing all the work. I'm not even getting paid for helping him find potential employees so imma just quit responding to people. 

I've been through so much with this cleaning company. I got reported over some rooms not being cleaned which was not my fault because my key card didn't give me access to those rooms until the end of July. I've been working since April. I tried to miss work the other day due to a stomach virus and he wouldn't let me, afraid I'd get reported again because that would make him look bad. 

I tried to miss a week because my grandpa had a heart attack and he wouldn't let me take care of him and got upset about me missing work just for four days. 

I'm so excited for this new job where I'll be working with children. The pay is higher too.",2,2
170,1366,"I'm 28, married to my partner who is 26. We have a year and a half old kid and own a home with a yard. We do activism in our community for lgbtq rights and have been disowned by half our family. 

I went to the local humane society the other day to check out a dog. I brought along my kid to make sure they were compatible and comfortable with each other. The dog I was originally looking at was way too timid and not comfortable so they brought out a different one that fit our household needs, as we also have a cat. It went great! The dog and kid got along. The dog was timid at first but warmed up after like 2 minutes and the kid knows how to approach and pet gently as we've been training with her since she was 6 months. 

They said they couldn't release her just yet and to come back 2 days (today) from now. I wanted to have my partner meet the dog first so it fit well in our schedule anyway. When we got to the shelter the same person was working and took us to a different room. We waited for about 10 minutes until she came back and said there was a problem. 

They had received 2 anonymous calls saying we weren't in the right place to adopt an animal. No name or anything left so they don't know who it was. They apologized profusely and said they couldn't give us the dog, but that there was no other red flags and they didn't get a bad vibe from us. They said they would email their manager to reconsider but they likely won't hear back until tomorrow. 

We've had smear campaigns against us because of our activism, mostly calling us groomers, and I've been afraid they would call cps on us but I never expected them to call the humane society. I'm just totally baffled and deflated. We likely will be able to adopt the dog, but the fact someone would call to prevent it, I can't believe it. 

If we are able to adopt the dog, her name will be Biscuit.",3,3
171,1367,"Today I was talking with a friend in school. Beside him were two of his friends from his class. We were waiting for a teacher to bring a ball so we could hoop a little before I went home. 

But there was this girl beside him who was one of his mates. During the conversation with me and my friend, she kept looking at me weirdly and then looking away when I looked back. In a weird way. Almost staring at me. 

When I said bye and turned my back, she started talking. And it felt like she was talking negatively about me behind my back. She was so awkward, the whole way through as I was talking with my friend. 

I had this sudden feeling of anger and hatred just rising within me. And many fantasies of killing her slowly popped up in my head. I had an overwhelming amount of hatred. I have never felt so angry and hateful towards someone for looking at me weirdly. 

It stuck with me in my head until all the way home. I stopped and tried to observe why I felt this way. But I couldn't understand. Worse things have happened in my life and I felt more passive about it. But this... It nearly ruined my whole day and I couldn't stop thinking about it.",3,3
172,1369,"I joined in 2013 right outta high school and left literally 2 days ago. The Army sucked, in fact it sucked a lot. I was initially an 88M but then reclassed to 25Q in 2017 and then did basically nothing. 

I got a lot of stupid stories I can share, but the basic thing is it just feels weird this chapter of my life is over and done with. Also, despite how much it sucked, I don't regret it. I met a ton of awesome people I otherwise wouldn't have, got to go to both Japan and South Korea, and got two degrees - English and Communications - for free. 

My dad tried to talk me into staying for the full 20, but I was just done with it all. I was so tired with it all. On my final final day, I was scheduled for a PT test and decided to take it really just for old times sake and to say goodbye to everyone another time and just chat. 

It was honestly nice to get to say goodbye to everyone again and plus I got a good score on this final PT test that doesn't mean anything lol. I was literally not in the Army anymore on the day I took it which was kinda funny. 

Sad a part is over, but happy as a new chapter in my life is starting. I look forward to what comes next.",2,2
173,137,"I was driving home and I noticed an old dog trying to cross the road. The dog was clearly old by the way it moved and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about its safety so I jumped out and got a collar and leash i had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. 

From there I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. The dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. 

I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning. Or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. 

I chose the latter so off we went in the dark following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend. 

At this point a car turned onto the street and pulled into it's driveway, I thought It would be a good chance to ask a neighbor if they had a clue whose dog this was. As luck turns out they knew the dog and pointed me to the home where i's family is and other than an awkward door knocking situation late at night everything went well and I was able to reunite the dog with its family.",2,2
174,1370,"I was abused as a child physically and mentally and have always been a people pleaser. I'm sure it comes from the constant need to win my parents' approval as well as the fear that I would be beaten if I got in trouble. I've been molested as a child by a distant relative we went to visit and have never told anyone because I feel ashamed or that I might get in trouble with my parents. Would they say it's my fault? Would they believe me? All of these things weighing on a 9 year old was a lot so I didn't say anything and just tried to forget it happened. 

In high school I got bullied by teachers at this school I went to. For example, some of my classmates goofed around and somehow I got the blame for not telling on them. Of course I was too scared to go home and tell because I'm sure I would've been told it's my fault. I really was a good student, got along with all my peers, and made some amazing friends whom I'm in touch with still. 

A lot later in life my parents wanted me to get married so I did. My husband is a great guy but his mother is an absolute asshole and our relationship starts to break because of it. I had severe depression and had her constantly picking away at me even more after we have our first baby. We are now on a very low contact basis with her and have moved out. 

Overall I feel I'm just a very bitter person because of everything that's happened and I suppose more than anyone I hate myself for not standing up for me when I should have. I'm at a point in my life where I've set boundaries so people can't overstep them and upset me and I'm not a doormat like I used to be. 

I do have the urge to call my parents and scream at them for how they raised me because my other siblings did not endure the kind of abuse I did but what good would actually come of it? They can't undo it. My husband is really supportive but I haven't told him everything. I feel like it would break his heart and I'm ashamed of some of it too.",3,3
175,1373,"My sister is evil. Her appearance is striking: fake boobs, platinum blonde hair like it's still the year 2000, adorning makeup which is reminiscent of Ursula, and false eyelashes so thick you wonder if they might wiggle away like a caterpillar. Always in pink, and always carrying her cigarettes. When people meet her, she performs the role of a submissive. She's just an innocent stay at home mom. She does not hesitate to ask for help. But it never, ever stops. I now have $15,000 lessons on being grifted. I have also gained friends that were grifted too. There's always a reason she asks for money, but yet she keeps those who help at a distance so we don't actually know where the money goes. She has no shame in asking for money and favors. She progressively escalates over time to see how much she can get out of someone, and disappears the rest of the time. 

Then there's the lying. She is a pathological liar, and I don't say that lightly. For my moms funeral last month, I paid for 100% of it. I told my sister that I wasn't giving her any more money, and that she hurt me a few days before the event. My sister didn't show up to the service, and told everyone there that she believed I would not acknowledge her son there. Her son, who I've been there for since day 1 and had nothing to do with us. She also wished for my mom's death so she could receive inheritance. She's just a total garbage human and it sucks to be related to her.",3,3
176,1374,"I just got a puppy. He's really cute and overall fairly well behaved for only being 2 months old. My mom and little brother love the dog, but he is supposed to be ""my dog"", and I kind of don't want him. I don't know why I feel this way, especially since we've only had him since last week. I feel really bad about it and I don't know what to do about it either. 

I've never had a pet, but I've wanted a dog for a few years now. I really thought I wanted one. I was super happy when we first brought him home and was excited out of my mind for the first few days. He's sleeping in my room, but he's annoying me a lot. ( I get annoyed easily, unfortunately ). He keeps biting my bed and a chair I have in my room that used to be my grandma's. I understand that his teeth are itchy, but he has a ton of toys he could bite. I however have no problems taking him out on walks and whatnot. 

I'm also a naturally messy person, so having a dog and having to keep my room clean at all times is really annoying for me. I am also suspecting that I might have ADD because I have a really hard time cleaning/going to school/and really doing anything even slightly time consuming. 

The thing is also kinda that whenever I'm in school, I have to go home at lunch to take him outside and play with him. This has also complicated things more, so I haven't been in school at all since we got him. And on top of that, I can't really afford to get much more school absence, or I'm going to have to retake a grade (again). I had big problems just getting myself to school before, and now it's just so much harder with him to think about. 

I think I've romanticized the whole ""having a puppy"" thing, unfortunately.",3,3
177,1378,"I've been hanging out with this girl for a few months and we became great friends. There was always some underlying tension between us, but neither of us acted on it. We hung out a couple of times, cuddled, but nothing more. To be honest, I'm not sure what I wanted from her. I guess I just wanted support. I wanted someone to share how I felt with. 

I had recently been through a bad breakup and I was doing everything self destructive I could think of. I wanted affection and comfort but I didn't have the energy to give any of it back. She did. She would always talk to me, help me through the day, comfort me, and encourage me to take care of myself. She would buy me anything I needed for myself, she cooked me homecooked meals. She would constantly check up on me. And to be honest, I was kind of a bad friend. I wasn't as caring and considerate as she was. I didn't really give her much comfort even though I depended on her for her care. 

After trauma dumping on her for a while and doing some inconsiderate things, she started distancing herself from me. I thought that it was always just the fact that she was kind of pretty and giving me the support I needed that made me attracted to her. In my mind, I labeled her as replaceable and a placeholder. 

But she's not that. She's genuinely funny, kind, beautiful, smart, and caring. She's everything a guy could want in a girl, but now she avoids me. I'm still not sure what I want out of this, but I know I made a mistake. And at this point I have no idea how to fix it.",3,3
178,1379,"I don't really know what real life friends are anymore. I had friends in elementary and middle school. I would always talk to them and we would laugh and do stuff together but we would never interact outside of school. After Covid hit most of my friends moved and anyone who stayed doesn't talk to me willingly. I don't understand why. 

Thinking about it I began to realize that they weren't real friends. They were people who I interacted with just to make school bearable. I began to realize that I had no real friends and wouldn't have any for the rest of my school life. People say your high school years are your best years but that hasn't been the case. 

I have become the really quiet kid who literally only spoke if he had to. I actively try to make sure no one knows who I am and hope no one will remember me. I feel empty and can't imagine having friends in real life again. 

I have online friends and have known them for years. They are the best thing to ever happen to me but I don't think I'll ever be able meet them in real life due to real life being a monster, money reasons and me being young. So I'm stuck here wondering if I'm going to be alone. If my online friends will eventually move on and I'll be completely alone. 

I feel I will forget what having friends is like and what a friend is. I can already imagine sitting in a dimly lit apartment and staring at the ceiling, empty, alone, and wondering what the point of everything is. I wouldn't cry though because I am actively losing the ability to. 

I just wonder if I will at least have friends in the future or if I will be completely alone, a shell doing stuff on autopilot.",3,3
179,138,"On Mother's Day of this year, I was told I was going to be a grandmother. My husband and I were having lunch with his daughter and her husband when she told us. We were at my favorite restaurant. My daughter had brought a bouquet of flowers and there was a note attached to them that told me to open the small gift first. 

I opened the gift and there were a pair of pink baby booties. I started smiling and asked her ""is this what I think it means?"" and she replied yes. Well, there were lots of hugs and laughter after that. 

I asked her a million of questions. She told us she was four months pregnant and the baby was a little girl. We talked about names and she told me she couldn't decide on which one - she had two selected. As of today, she has not told us the name. 

I was so excited that day for her and her husband, I could barely eat my lunch. It truly was the most memorable day during the past 6 months for me. I could not think of any other days more exciting than that one. 

Now I am anticipating the birth of the baby and hope to be there when she is born and then that will be the most exciting day for me this year for sure.",3,3
180,1380,"I feel alone. It is so frustrating. I used to be fine with it, but then for some reason I actually started wanting to have a friend. I have nobody. And nobody around me seems interesting enough to me. Life gets boring. And frustrating. 

I am a frustrated person. I want to feel romantic love but I only feel it for my ex, and it is the slightest amount so I cling onto it. I don't know if I'm aromantic or something. It is so frustrating having to chase that feeling. My ex was the only one ever to give me a slight feeling of romance. I do not get crushes. I would never kiss someone, touch makes me cringe. 

But I want the picture perfect life. Nothing will make me stop wanting a wife and family. And my ex is the only one I could possibly have it with. 

I am so lonely and I know it is just messing with my head. Nobody understands me. People think I'm weird and crazy. Everyone does. Nobody is here for me. Nobody knows who I really am. And I feel like I can't relate with anybody all of the time. People frustrate me so much yet I need them to fill some void in me. 

I worry. I distract myself with school, but each day I come home and it's the same. The feeling of dread. I hate myself. I hate everything. 

I've been less timid. Trying to be more approachable looking. It doesn't work. I put myself in situations to talk to people. We don't get past surface level stuff. 

I am trapped in this isolation. It gets me so mad. I am trying. I physically can't speak at times and I have to use hand gestures a lot. I can't speak! What else am I supposed to do?! My voice is wrong when I do manage to speak. It is not expressive or funny. People think I have no emotion and I am so serious. 

I just want to be normal. I am not normal. Something is wrong with me but I don't know what. 

I just want a real friend. I just want my ex back. I hate my life, I hate myself.",3,3
181,1381,"I wasn't really ever that close with my mother. I would see her as a child when I could, because she had diabetes and her mental health was bad. She also had substance issues and a new boyfriend every 3 months. 

One day my grandma gets a call that my mom is in the hospital. That day I decided to not go into her hospital room because I was used to visiting her in the hospital due to her health. I always regret that I didn't go see her. I don't even remember the last time I saw her alive. 

She was in a coma. I was 11 years old when she died. My mom was friends with drug addicts, and what not so I never knew fully how she died. Some of my family members told me it was from heroine. Others say it was her diabetes. I don't even know who was with her when she spoke her last words. 

She died a couple weeks after I just started middle school. I felt so alone. The last time I saw her was in an open casket with 10 pounds of makeup to cover up. 

I was still grieving so I decided to skip her funeral because I was scared.",3,3
182,1386,"All these backhanded compliments like ""wow you look good for 30"" need to go. Nobody ever says things like ""wow you look good for 23"". Why? Because it's expected that you will look good at 23. But apparently as the clock strikes midnight and you turn 30, you are supposed to turn into a rotten pumpkin like that carriage in the Cinderella cartoon. 

We dont live in 1840 anymore. People don't age that quickly and drastically anymore! You are supposed to look young at 30! Because you ARE young at 30. 

Yet every time I see a beautiful 30-year-old woman post a selfie there are always people in the comments acting like they are so surprised she looks good cause of course she is supposed to look like a wrinkly grandma. 

We can't say the rational part of the brain isn't fully developed until age 25 and at the same time act like you get old once you turn 30. Are you saying that I only had 5 years of my life to enjoy the time when I was fully developed but not old yet? Sounds pretty unfair if you ask me. 

If you want to compliment a person, just say ""you look good"". Don't say ""you look good for 30"" just the same way you wouldn't say ""you're funny for a woman"".",3,3
183,1388,"My mom died 10 years ago. October 1st, 2012. And I didn't even remember the anniversary. 

I was really young when she died of breast cancer. My step mom has been in my life for longer than my bio mom was. I call my step mom mom. When people ask about my parents, she's mom. I only ever mention bio mom when I need to. 

It doesn't feel like she was even real. I was so young. I've basically forgotten her. People tell me all these things about her, and it feels like I'm hearing about a stranger. I just smile and nod because what else can i do? 

People always tell me they're sorry for my loss, but I feel like they shouldn't be. It doesnt feel like my loss. It almost feels like I'm in a video game and her death took place before the events of the game. 

I know it happened, but I barely remember anything. Does that make me a bad child? She gave so much for me, wanted to be with me until the very end, and I can barely remember any of it. 

I feel like a terrible person for forgetting the anniversary, for forgetting her.",3,3
184,139,"I was on my way back from a trip with my mother, brother, and partner and our return flight got canceled for unknown reasons. We got up at 5 am and went to the airport anyway and found out that several flights for our airline had been canceled due to hail damage to the plane. The line to re-book at the airline counter was extremely long and workers suggested we re-book on our own. 

When I went online to check out alternate flights home, I saw that we could not fly out on the same airline till two days later. My mother and I do not have the greatest relationship so I was very eager to get home and away from her. I found the prospect of two more days with her very frustrating. I also needed to be back in town for work. I was extremely frustrated and anxious trying to decide what to do. 

My mother does not know how to book flights or use travel sites so I re-booked us on a much more expensive flight from another airline. I felt extremely stressed about the cost but I knew I needed to get back ASAP. The flight I booked ended up being $515 a person, compared to the original $100 a person. I put all of the tickets on my credit card because I know my mom has bad credit and also would have to carry over a balance for a few months to pay it off. 

I really hated having all of that on my card and feared I would never be reimbursed. The flight I booked also required us to wait in the airport for 7 hours. I have a pretty intense fear of flying, so the anticipation was also distressing. Overall it was a very distressing experience and it made me not want to travel for a while.",3,3
185,1393,"I went out to dinner today with my mum, my brother and his wife. My mum mentioned how grandma nearly died yesterday. Grandma lives in China and she has dementia. She was missing yesterday night and they found her wedged between a harbour and a ship. All wet, cold and injured. My mum was clearly upset but was staying strong. She said how grandma is growing old and that she doesnt remember things anymore. 

At this moment, my brother was like she repeated it 4 times already. I was annoyed when he said that because of his lack of empathy. Afterwards, when my mum is finally done talking about grandma, my brother said to me and his wife in English. They should just euthanise grandma since she's so old and that she doesn't even remember who she is. I was really annoyed when he said that because of the timing. This event is still so raw. My mum is upset and I'm upset about it. 

Anyways, afterwards, my mum then asked me what happened (she doesn't understand English). I told her oh my brother said to euthanise grandma. My mum got angry at my brother. My brother then started telling me off for telling my mother about. I then argued with my brother about how he's saying this stuff to get a reaction and to have your opinion rather than actually caring about mum. 

My brother has always been like that. If we watch a documentary of kids starving, he'll say something like ""Well, I don't care about them because it's not me"". If we were watching something about how animals are getting killed for their skin, he'll say stuff like ""mass extinction happens all the time!"". Like he say these stuff to be witty. Anyways, he then started arguing with my mum about how he's right, saying stuff like you're stupid and stuff. My mum said grandma still wants to live. They're still arguing. 

What I'm mad about is the fact that my brother clearly wants to be right rather than actually caring about his family like he claims he is.",3,3
186,1398,"I love someone who doesn't love me. We are both in high school, but different ones. We met in 8th grade, and at first I just thought she was a shy but nice girl, but I got to know her and we became best friends. We helped each other through tough times and I started to love her. We were very close and I thought she might like me too. 

I told her at the end of the year online because I was too scared to say it to her face. She said she just loved me as her best friend, nothing more. And since then a combination of that and moving to different high schools and we have stopped talking much. 

I love her so much and have never felt like this for anyone. But she's such a good person who doesn't know it, and is so beautiful on the inside. I want to be with her for the rest of my life but she doesn't want me. 

I don't know what to do. I love her so much, I want to be with her and hold hands and just coexist with her, but we never talk, we go months without speaking and when we talk it's just chatter, not like the actual convos we used to have. 

I can tell I messed it up by telling her, and now what we had is ruined.",3,3
187,1399,"I had a childhood that pretty badly messed up a lot of things. Then as an adult my first serious relationship was abusive, my second was chaotic and my third I ended out of a misplaced self preservation instinct during the worst time of my life. 

Then just as I was circling the drain I met someone. They reignited my drive to do the things I love and make the best of myself. To put it simply they made me want to be alive again. Every day became exciting, not the same slog I'd been trying to push through for so long, but just complete wonder. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it just built and got better and better. A few moments with them stand out as the happiest of my life. 

But eventually things fell apart in stages, ending with me seeing a side of them I never knew was there. Something that touched on some very difficult things in my past and made me feel like everything had been a lie. Some very cruel things were said using vulnerabilities I had opened up to them about over years that no one else knew. 

Now as I've been trying to move on from that I've come up on another issue. I just can't seem to date anymore. It was before Covid that I met them so for a while I brushed this off as just being out of practice but I realised that wasn't the problem. I have no problem getting dates, my problem is I just can't summon the interest in anyone I meet in a dating context. People I meet randomly who I've had a flicker of interest in all end up being taken and I end up feeling relieved more than disappointed. 

I can't even have casual encounters because I just keep thinking about that person and I can never go through with it even when I've got people over specifically for that. I feel trapped and so very lonely. Despite everything I still find it impossible to imagine being with anyone who isn't them. 

Even though I really want a relationship, I want to love and be loved but I don't know how to do that anymore. I'm exhausted.",3,3
188,14,"In the last three to six months, an event that was striking for me was taking my son to an amusement park for the first time. We went to King's Island. My son is five, but large for his age (big enough to go on every ride in the ""Kiddie"" part of the park), but he has a developmental disorder, with issues predominantly centered around attention and language. This has given him some social delays as well - and so often in exciting places (like an amusement park) it can be tough to maintain his attention on something that I want him focused on. 

 

Also, there are times when he doesn't have the language to communicate his needs or express what he's thinking about. Despite this, he's adventurous and likes to try new things, so going to an amusement park is sort of ""up his alley"" but also a type of situation that can give me anxiety due to the language and attention challenges. 

 

This trip was amazing. My son was completely excited and had the time of his life. We had worked on the word ""brave"" and he continued to use this term to describe himself at the park. He'd go up to one of the kiddie rides and express that he was going to be brave and then I'd watch him just rise to the moment. 

 

I'll be honest, I'm getting emotional just remembering the look on his face when he was utterly terrified of a ride, wanted to be on it, and didn't want me to ride it with him. He told me he was going to be ""Brave"" and the determination and maturity as he faced his fear, and handled it was amazing. 

 

And beyond that, the pride he had when he got off that little ride fills my heart. There were some language difficulties, when I was asking him about some of the adult rides, ""What do you think of that one? That looks big! That looks scary."" He clearly misunderstood my intentions and got into a panic, becoming really scared and shouting ""I don't want to ride it!"" He calmed down when my wife explained that she wasn't going to make him get on the big rides. 

 

Although, honestly, he gave me a skeptical look as if to say, ""You won't Mom, but I dunno about Dad...."" He was amazing, and it was a fantastic experience this summer. It helped us see how far he had come in his development and with his language use.",3,3
189,140,"I recently received my token for being two years clean and sober at my local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, as well as my Narcotics Anonymous meeting. It was a very calm and peaceful morning filled with a lot of excitement and pride. I walked into the meeting feeling a little nervous, but once the leader of the meeting began to speak, my nerves settled and I felt more comfortable and accomplished. 

The leader made a brief statement about how far I had come in my recovery / journey, how proud she was of me, and how I had touched and affected her life. Once she finished making her speech, she introduced me, as well as presented me with my two year token and a very beautiful cake. 

Afterwards, my sponsor surprised me by making an appearance. Initially, she had told me that she would be unable to attend, which made me very disappointed because she was and is such an important part of my sobriety and recovery. My sponsor came to the front of the room and made a speech about me and my recovery, which made me cry because it was very emotional. 

After this, everyone in the room had cake and many of them came up to me individually to congratulate me and praise my success in recovery. Many of the participants of the meeting brought me little gifts and keepsakes, which made me feel very special. One of the gifts I received was a little box that had my sobriety / clean date engraved on it, as well as a very special quote that I find inspiration in. ""For where your treasure is there your heart will be also"". 

My sponsor gave me a journal that had an inscription inside the front cover from her along with my sobriety / clean date. This was a very memorable event because I have worked very hard to overcome a great deal of vices in my life, including addiction and the underlying conditions and issues that have had an impact on my addiction. 

To be able to stand up in front of a room filled with my peers and honestly say that I have been clean and sober for two years was such a memorable and special experience and event.",3,3
190,1400,"I used to hate my dad with a certain passion that now I can only describe as ignorantly hating someone. But now I love him more than I thought I ever would. The only thing I have to thank for this is football and sports as a whole. 

I'm 18 and for the years between 2015 and 2019 I hated my dad. I didn't want to hear his voice or even see him. But when I got into high school and played for my school's football team and he showed up to my first game because my older sister told him I was playing I started feeling happier than I thought I'd ever be and felt ashamed for the first time in my life. 

But it wasn't just the first game. It was one after the other. He missed the ones that were like an hour drive from our town but he was there for almost every one of them. I'll never forget the look in his eyes when he hugged me tighter than I'd ever felt him hug me and heard that deep bellow in his voice that I once thought annoying. 

I heard the words, ""Son, I'll never not be proud of you"" after we had lost our game ending season. But he didn't care that we lost. He cared that I had worked. I never felt very confident during that first year but just hearing him tell me that made me happier than I'd ever been. It gave me this sense of pride that I'd never felt. 

My dad changed my life by being there. He changed my life by making me realize that his past doesn't define who he is now. He made me change more than I thought I could.",3,3
191,1405,"I'm transgender, and a failed artist. I've never been abused but I didn't come from a happy home. For the longest time in my life, I was deeply unhappy. I was in a loop, I couldn't get a surgery to fix something that made my body repulsive to me because the doctors thought I was too depressed to endure it, and I was depressed because I was repulsed. I'd given up ever finding true love or a job I could endure. I had accepted nobody would want someone like me, either to love them or work for them. The things I could offer were simply not enough. 

Today I woke up, bandages on my chest, with hands working well enough to draw. Surgery I had been fighting for for 15 years, and I finally had it, I'm free! As soon as I got my phone back, I sent the message to my boyfriend, the sweetest love of my life who is my sun and moonlight and my northern star, that everything went so great, I don't feel at all as bad as I was told that this would feel. 

And I could draw, as I got my sketchbook back. I drew a little comic to let my online followers know that it was great, I can draw! I drew a comic about my relationship with my partner, that is how much I adore him, and people like them, they can relate with their own boyfriends, girlfriends and love of their life. 

Once I can get to my locker to get headphones, I'm going to relax for the rest of the evening, watching videos of gold leaf application and other art piece restoration, art which I love and only recently realised I could study as a career! 

I just startled the nurse who was about to bring me a cup of coffee, and I had to reassure her I'm just crying tears of joy.",3,3
192,141,"This week, my son started first grade. He is the youngest of all of my children and the only boy. He was in kindergarten last year, and that was hard for me as well, as I had to come to terms with the fact that he was growing up and wasn't my little baby anymore. However, it was only kindergarten so he still felt like a ""baby"" to me. 

This year however, he is noticeably older and more grown up. As he walked down the street towards the bus on his first day of first grade, he looked like a ""big kid"" instead of my little baby. It made me both happy and sad. As he is becoming such a wonderful young man, yet at the same time my little baby no longer is little (This is also evident as his clothes from last year are too small. Last year they were too big). 

Most surprisingly, he wasn't scared or nervous this year. At the start of kindergarten last year, he cried and begged me to stay home. I really wanted to keep him home as well! This year, he didn't cry for me or try to run back home for another hug. I was glad he was feeling more independent, but part of me wished he needed me more. 

My little man is growing up so fast. I wish I could turn back the time and keep him my baby forever. Although I cannot, he will still always be ""mama's baby"".",3,3
193,1411,"This morning, I found out I am going to my first public school, which is within a biking distance from my house. After finding this out, I discover that tomorrow, I must awaken in the morning 1 hour earlier than usual as to prepare for my day because I am getting contacts tomorrow, and my glasses come in next week. I will finally be able to see! 

After that whole thing, I felt amazing and decided to get stuff done, and I believe I was quite productive. After that, I rode my bicycle and got to pet 10 dogs They were all very happy to sniff me and lick me, and I was very happy to scratch behind their ears and give them my complete attention. 

After petting the 6th fur angel, I found a really cool looking tree that looked like an umbrella, but completely natural, dome shape and all. I sat under said tree and became very happy. 

On my way home, I did not have issues riding up the extremely steep hill which I normally ride down, and made it home, where I cooked some rice, did more school work, and was snuggled by my dog. 

All in all, I hope tomorrow is just as great, because I am now in a positive mood and do not ever want the happiness to end!",3,3
194,1412,"Outside of a job/income, I've got everything I could want. A little apartment with the love of my life with flowers on the windowsill, and plans to tidy up and furnish the place. None of the things that I dreaded from my old homes have followed me here. Everything's pleasant and peaceful, I can trust that the person I want to make happy in life also wants me to be happy, we do things together to make ourselves a nice home. 

There's no bitterness or spite or taking bad moods out to anyone, he's just as interested as I am about making a nice home we'll both enjoy. It's become a habit for both of us to just go express affection as a sign of being in a good mood, for something completely unrelated. The apartment is small so I can stop to kiss him on my way to the fridge and back, we can kiss while hanging up laundry, and hold hands while running boring errands and getting groceries. I can make him laugh. 

Today he laid down on the bed for a while to get a break from sitting while gaming. So I went to kiss him, and as I got up, I took off his left sock and took it with me. He was so baffled that I'd do something like that for literally no reason that he started laughing, and his laughter is sunshine. 

Today we're taking my old, broken table to recycling, it was replaced by the nice, prettier, sturdy table his parents bought for us. The apartment we share together is still a chaotic mess, but it is the mess that I want to be in. Life is nice.",3,3
195,142,"My youngest son was to enter PS3 this year. It was both exciting and terrifying as I knew he is my last child and I had a mix of feelings. I wanted it to be wonderful, yet it was hard to let him go and know that he was moving on and progressing in life to an older more mature age for a young child. I knew he would be in PS3 all day long and wanted it to be something he loved and looked forward to. He is very affectionate and calm and I had a positive attitude overall about everything. 

I was a bit worried as he had not been fully potty trained for poop yet and that was a requirement. He also loves his blankie and I wondered if that would be an issue. So he started this week, yesterday actually. All went well and I am very relieved. 

Two days ago we had a day of adaptation where parents went in with their child to get to know the feel of the classroom and what a day at school would be like. He did well yesterday and enjoyed time with new friends and came home happy. He was very hungry after a long day, and tired. So he went to bed early than normal, which is good as that was another expectation I had. 

He was a bit fussy this morning, as he has to get up earlier than normal, but did well overall. He was happy when I left him in the classroom. I am so relieved and thankful that this has been a relatively easy transition and hope it stays that way.",2,2
196,1423,"I am in a long distance relationship but I am separated from my significant other by a few hours. I am a nurse at a great hospital but quite frankly, my management sucks and my doctors act like Karens. I have woken up dreading going to work for so long that it's my normal. These people have sucked the joy out of what I so passionately love to do. 

I did try to wait it out to see if things would get better over time, but with no success. We've been together for less than a year but have talked about closing the gap. I've met his family and friends and vice versa. Nothing but good things from both sides. 

This guy I am sure with every cell in my body that we're destined to be together. I'm gonna husband that man someday. I would be the moving party between the both of us and I'm absolutely okay with that. 

I had updated my resume and sent some applications out last week, not expecting to hear anything from anyone until this week. I have an interview set for Friday morning and if all goes well, I will accept a position in my significant other's town doing what I love to do! 

And that means we can finally start our lives together. And that gives me so much hope for the future.",3,3
197,1425,"I grew up playing an all-girls' sport. I never was really friends with the other girls because they were always talking about boys and makeup and drama while I was always more focused on my grades, college, or reading.I didn't dislike any of them, just always felt out of the loop and disconnected. I was homeschooled so my only interaction with other people my age was these eight or so girls who hung out all the time and never invited me. They weren't always trying to be mean but they were always closer with each other because they shared common interests. 

I would try to not let it get to me, but it always hurt that everyone seemed to always have someone to talk to and I had nobody. My mom always told me I would find my group eventually and it would just make the friendship that much more valuable. 

Well, I finally found my group. It's a strange friend group but I feel connected. And on top of that, I actually have a best friend! I started a new sport last year and found I had a lot more in common with my training partners. Granted, most of them are a good ten to twenty years older than I am but we're all really close and talk a lot. 

I also have someone to call my best friend! I never would have imagined someone like her actually being friends with me. She likes dressing up and going out, is extroverted, optimistic, a go with the flow kind of person, and isn't super competitive. I, on the other hand, hate shopping/dressing up, view myself as a nerd, am a little more negative, feel the need to plan everything down to the minute, and am super competitive to the point where I spend all my free time training. She also is a very touchy-feely person, whereas I am not so much. 

Recently, we became very close to the point where she will sometimes refuse to go places with the rest of the friend group if I'm not able to go because she feels closer to me than the others. The other day, she mentioned that she got me something small for my birthday and I am so happy. She actually remembered my birthday after I only mentioned it once and, as if just remembering it weren't enough, felt the need to get me something. 

I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found someone who values me as a person and the friendship doesn't feel one sided!",3,3
198,1429,"I always have felt behind in my life compared to my friends and other people I know. I'm 17 and I can't drive, I've never had a boyfriend, and I don't know what my plans are for the future. I felt so bad, like I was lesser than. 

But this summer I got a job, and since there was no school, and it was under the table. I worked six days a week, like 60 hours a week. I was just going through the motions. 

And here I am today, checking my bank account for the first time, and I have a balance of $7, 636.41. I can't believe I earned that! It feels SO good! None of my friends have jobs, and they always have to ask their parents for money, but here I am with this hefty loft! 

And then also today, I finally got confirmation that I just got another job. Today is going so well! I feel like I'm really able to conquer the world and save money, and that when I move out next year, I'll know what to do. I can finally afford driving school, and I may not have any big plans, but now I'm going to get my CNA training with the Red Cross, because a woman I know offered me a job to be her in-house CNA if I get training. 

And after I get experience there I can try for this healthcare agency, and I'll be able to make a higher wage traveling between locations, and I can pick what days I work and what shifts or if I even want to work at all that week. 

Things are finally starting to piece together. Everything feels so clear, and right. Like I have a path to go down now, and I'm doing it ALL BY MYSELF! Nobody handed anything to me, nobody helped me with this. I DID THIS!! 

I just feel so proud and hopefully I can start saving for a car or I'll have to figure out how loans work.",3,3
199,143,"About 2 months ago my wife and I decided to move across the country. We are both originally from the Pacific Northwest and about a decade ago we both had nothing and we flew across the country with almost nothing to our names to start our life on the east coast. She had a sick grandmother that needed care and we stayed with her and made our life out there. 

 

About 6 months ago her grandmother passed away and we both kind of realized that we didn't really like living there, but we also couldn't leave her grandma alone. So we decided to pack up our stuff in our car and a u-haul and drive back to the Pacific Northwest since both of our families are here and they were sort of asking us to come back. 

 

I remember very vividly our drive back across the country. I had this moment where I just felt free, like a huge weight had been lifted off both of us. Her grandmother was really nice and helped us so much when we were young and lost in life, to be fully clear. However, after nearly a decade of taking care of her it was a huge relief to just be free to worry about ourselves and focus on our lives and our relationship fully. 

 

That trip was maybe the best 2 weeks of my life. We took our time and saw the sights from coast to coast but the best part was definitely our time spent at the grand canyon. I always thought something like that was neat but pretty boring but seeing it for myself at that specific time in my life with the woman I love is something I'll never forget. 

 

We made it safely back home and now we're busy starting our lives with our families near us. I'd say we're in the best spot we've ever been in as far as our relationship is concerned. I give a lot of that credit to that trip and my wife for being so understanding.",3,3
200,1430,"I am a medical technology student and we are studying phlebotomy this semester. My hometown is in a province but I moved to the city to study college. I don't have friends in the city and university. I also live alone. My classmates were able to practice drawing blood from their friends and roommates. I cannot practice because I do not have anyone to practice with. 

I was able to talk with 4 of my classmates but they have already known each other for years so I'm a bit left out of the group. Earlier was our practical in drawing blood. It's like a demo and it's also graded. I was nervous but I remained calm. My partner drew blood from me first and she was shaking out of nervousness! Fortunately, she was able to draw blood from me. 

When I was going to draw blood from her, I was surprisingly calm. I was not shaking. At first, I was not able to get the blood so I moved the needle slightly and saw the backflow of blood! I was so happy! It was the first time I drew blood! Although, my professor deducted points because I did not fill up my syringe even though I could. But still, I'm very happy because I was able to draw blood without practice and only watching my classmates do it. 

If I told this to my mom, she will also be very happy!",2,2
201,1431,"I suffer from major depressive disorder (and about half a dozen other DSM-V diagnoses) and I hesitated for years to get another pet because I was worried I couldn't provide the kind of care and attention they need and deserve. 

Then the pandemic came. With the freedom of being fortunate enough to work from home, I felt like I had a choice to either use my newfound free time to accelerate my self-destruction through isolation and substance abuse (which I absolutely did for the first few months of quarantine) or find a way to actually improve my life -- and that's what I've done my best to work toward for the last year. 

I moved out of my parents' house at an embarrassingly late age and bought one of my own, something I'm incredibly proud of and was very lucky to have been able to do. I got back into therapy and decided to try some new medications with as much patience as I could muster. I started taking a bit better care of myself physically and spending more time around people, especially my handful of good friends. 

Feeling better about myself than I have in a while, I finally ran out of excuses not to go through with the adoption and went to the local humane society. I met a dozen or so dogs but there was only one I felt an immediate connection to and I took her home that day. 

She was nervous at first in her new environment and didn't even want to join me on the couch but, after a couple days of realizing I wouldn't ever leave her, she was already sleeping on my lap. She follows me everywhere and loves to play and cuddle. She had a play date with a friend's dog yesterday and she had so much fun that she's still exhausted. Plus she gets me moving which I desperately needed! 

As a depressed person who also feels like he can give a rescue a happy life, I'm confident it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I am genuinely happy for the first time in at least a decade when I'm around her and worry constantly when I occasionally can't be. 

I can't wait to travel again now that this viral nightmare has finally began to wind down and I'm so looking forward to taking her with me.",3,3
202,1433,"I am both debilitatingly excited and nervous right now. I have been quite lonely for what feels like most of my entire life, but I was lucky enough to meet this guy in one of my classes a couple of weeks or so ago who is very nice and actually seems to have some sort of interest in me. We've especially been talking more this week, and I was so happy because he asked for my number a couple days ago. 

Today when we were talking towards the end of class, though, I had mentioned that a couple things I really like are photography and hiking. One thing he asked was about which trail was my favorite, and when I told him, he said he really liked that one too because it was pretty close and he enjoyed going mountain biking there. Eventually, he said that he would love to take me there this weekend, because I had mentioned that I didn't really have any plans. I said that sounded like it would be super fun and that I'd be happy to go with him, and by the end of our chat, he said he would call me later so we could work out our plans. 

Fast forward to when I was at home, and I was so nervous once again for when he would call me because it's actually our first time talking on the phone and doing something outside of school. When he did call, my heart was practically pounding, but I was able to answer it on time. He's picking me up at 11 in the morning tomorrow, and I think I'm more excited than I've ever been. 

I wasn't so sure what to make of it, but he actually called it ""our date"" while we were on the phone, so I cannot get that out of my head now. I already have some nice memories from that specific trail we're going on, and it now means even more to me than ever that I'm actually going on my first date ever there. 

I never would've expected something like this to happen in my life even a month or so ago (especially because I didn't even know him very well at all then), and I thought I would just get through high school being almost completely alone and maybe meet someone special in my adult life if I'm lucky, but I guess things really can get better!",3,3
203,1434,"I'm somewhere on the spectrum of being a hoarder. I have severe hyperempathy for inanimate objects, including clothes, stuffed animals, toys, books, and a lot more. It's close to impossible for me to throw these things away or even donate them. I also have depression and I'm physically disabled, so cleaning is very hard on me and I have very little motivation. 

I buy things that I don't need and then throw them on one of the piles in my room and forget about them. I hoard yarn, I have so much that I've never used. My room was a death trap. The worst part was a very old extension cord/power strip buried in yarn and general trash. I couldn't see the floor in almost the entire room. I had to wipe my feet off to get in bed because just walking through my room got so much dirt on them. It smelled really bad and there was trash everywhere. It was such a fire hazard. Not even getting into the bugs. 

Today I finished my final exams and since my ADHD meds hadn't worn off I was really motivated, so I started cleaning my room. I can actually see the floor!! I've found so many things and I feel so much safer because I got all the stuff cleared out from around that power strip. 

I still have a long way to go, I'm taking a break right now, but I'm so proud of myself. I've filled up three big trash bags and I'm working on a fourth, and I have another bag full of clothes to donate. I'm probably going to crash pretty bad later, but I have tomorrow off work too so it'll be okay. I've been needing to do this for a really long time. It's not going to be perfect but it's a lot safer and I feel a lot better and that's what matters.",3,3
204,1436,"I remember when I first opened my bank account at 16 the first thing my Dad said was 'DONT GET A CREDIT CARD'! Although it was always tempting I didn't, until I did. I met a girl who at the time I didn't know was kinda rich. When we met I was only making 11,000 a year after taxes. She was making 40,000 after taxes. We decided to go on holiday and even though she offered I couldn't let her pay the bulk of it. So I got a credit card. And we used that as spending money. 

I got a credit card and my thinking was literally 'maybe owing the bank will encourage me to get better prospects.' Surprisingly enough IT DID. Risky game though. I went to college and used the credit card to pay for it thinking it's gonna be am investment. It was. I still wasn't making much but entry level I was making more than I was when we had met. 

We've been together 10 years and will have been married for 5 years in May. During these 10 years I've quit smoking and drinking heavily. I still drink but it's like once a month and not everyday like I was when I first met my wife. 

When my wife told me she was pregnant the first time, my mind went don't let your kids have your debt. And I made my final payment today. I checked my statements and my initial use was 3,000 and over the years between college it amassed to about 7,000. I payed the bank at least 10,000 overall. But it's finally over. I am debt free.",2,2
205,1438,"I work in the event industry and covid did its number on usbut restrictions are finally loosened enough for us to do our job the way we used to. Half my body hurts, I'm definitely not getting enough sleep and won't have a day off that I can actually spend on my couch for the next 2 weeks. 

This sounds bad, but it's exactly what I need right now. Having fun work days with my colleagues, who are equally as crazy as I am, doing a job I enjoy and feeling my sore muscles when I'm back home. My mental health has gotten so much better in the past two weeks. 

Before that I was touring with a couple of folks who made me feel unwelcome and I constantly felt like no matter what I was doing, it wasn't enough. I did overestimate my skill and took over responsibilities I wasn't ready for, so their frustration is understandable, but it still took its toll on my mental health. Hard work isn't nearly as much fun if it's not appreciated. 

Luckily I'm back and everything's gotten better. I randomly smile. I want to remember the day when I go to bed instead of hoping I'd forget it soon. I look forward to tomorrow instead of dreading it and I actually feel happy. This hasn't happened in a long time.",3,3
206,144,"The diagnosis of endometriosis will be with me for as long as I live. My journey started with the abdominal pain and has now lead me to treatment for infertility with some amazing doctors. I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say, it only got worse. 

I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall which ended up being not infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis. They did a biopsy of a ""mass"" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis. With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years. 

Finally in May I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now give me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby. It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy, but in the long run I know it will be well worth the wait. 

I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists. The pills I take are usually not that bad on me, however the shot that I have to take is what really gets me. I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days. 

We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only. I think we are going to try and start IUI/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby. I know that it will help me to increase my chances of pregnancy. 

Hopefully in the next year we will be welcoming our own little baby into this world. I CAN'T WAIT!!",3,3
207,1444,"The expectations on both sides, from my mother and father, were always to do well in school. There was never a question about whether or not I would go to college. It was when I got to college and lost my support and scaffolding system that I completely fell apart. I had been so successful for so long and I could not figure out why I could not pull it together. Because I struggled. 

Now I understand and know it was my ADHD. I had no clue at the time what it was. I started working in the classroom and the first day in the classroom, I fell in love. What I discovered was preschoolers all to some degree have ADHD. So, we got along fine. They have 10 minute attention spans, so do I, so the activities were cool. It was just the perfect job for me. I was like, why didn't anybody tell me I could do this before? 

I didn't really get my act together until probably my late 20s or early 30s. I accept that I have challenges and sometimes I'm not gonna do stuff right. Be able to forgive yourself and other people. Move on to the next hurdle because there's always gonna be another hurdle.",2,2
208,145,"A memorable time that comes to mind, is my sons birthday. He really wanted to go away for his day but we just didn't see it being financially possible. Somehow, my husband and I managed to get our funds in order and we were able to take the family to Disney. He was so excited. And to top it all off, he even got to eat at Cinderella's castle on the morning of his birthday. 

I am not sure who was more thrilled- him or I! We got to go to quite a few Disney parks and do some cool things. In Disney Springs we went on a hot air balloon which was really neat! We also went to dinner and afterwards went on a vintage car ride in the water. It lasts about 20 minutes but it was quite unique to say the least. 

Some new things like Disney's new Toy Story land were a big hit. It was our first time there since they added all of that. The slinky dog ride was awesome and worth the VERY long wait. 

I definitely won't forget this day and I know he won't either. Putting a smile on my child's face just means the world to me. I am so happy we were able to go. Not only for his birthday, but also to finally take a much needed family vacation. It's been quite awhile since we moved and I had to start working more hours. 

Although this day wasn't my birthday, it sure was a memorable day!",2,2
209,1450,"I thought I wanted to be an intellectual property lawyer because I knew I wanted to do something with technology. But I also had this fear that I was gonna get into a line of work that I was gonna hate. So I really had to take a step back as I was studying to go to law school, and just really determine what I wanted to do with my life. So I just really evaluated really two things. What am I passionate about, and then what are my natural skill sets? What am I good at? 

And I was realizing , I love a lot of things. I love technology, I love philanthropy. I love sports because I just love working in a team environment, so how can I maybe incorporate those three things? 

And then when I met my co-founder, who was my roommate at the time, he was basically saying, why don't we disrupt the e-waste industry by getting companies to donate their technology instead of recycling it, and helping others gain access to that technology so we could share our passion. 

Once we were talking about that, I knew exactly, that's what I needed to be doing. It's really weird, because all of that confusion and fear went away immediately, evaporated. That's kinda how human-I-T came to be. 

If you're tenacious, determined, and you get people to help you out, there's nothing that you guys can't do, for sure.",2,2
210,1451,"Losing my family very young was kind of a life changing experience. I've been working in the film industry for a number of years and so to kind of channel that energy and that angst I was feeling, I wanted to open a school, a cinema and a retail space. 

Lisa Marr is a teacher and we fell in love. On the opening day she was walking down the street and I said we're opening a film center and she's like, really? And she came in and she started volunteering and we had this platonic relationship that evolved into a romantic relationship. It was the beginning of a whole new chapter in my life. 

I had just started making films. I had been in a band for many years and did some photography and painting and there was this space right in my own neighborhood that was opening and encouraging people to come in and exchange ideas and watch films together and make their own movies. 

The education, in the last 10 years we've taught a couple of thousand kids for free. So for the ten year anniversary, we decided let's take everything we do on the road. Again, for us, filmmaking is about storytelling. It's not about the technology, it's not about expensive equipment, it's about an idea and some energy.",2,2
211,1453,"Well, I was always that kid in school that helped the teacher set up connecting to the projector and that kind of stuff. My brother was always tinkering with computers and then tearing them apart and building his own. And I would get his scraps, I would get his old computer. And so it really started with him being a role model and bringing this kinda stuff into my life. 

And then from there, I just always knew I wanted to be in computers because there's not many people that know a lot about computers. At first when I went into college, I went in as a computer engineer. And I found out very quickly that I did not like it. And then, I switched over to information assurance and have not looked back at all. 

Confidence is key, definitely. Keep your confidence. You've gotta believe in yourself, gotta keep it together. Sometimes, you fall apart, sometimes that happens. And it's okay because you gotta show people who you are and what you want and stand up for yourself. 

Get out there, get the experience, do the competitions, go to the conferences, listen to other people's experiences, and by all means, never give up. Don't let anybody tell you that you can't ever.",2,2
212,1456,"I grew up in Nanjing, China. When I was a baby I lost my right leg in a fire. Shortly after that I was abandoned on the street. I was found at a year and a half old and taken to the local government orphanage. Fortunately for me, I was adopted when I was seven years old and came here to the states. 

When I was 14 years old, I received a running prosthetic. The day that I ran, I remember it being one of the most traumatizing days of my whole life. That was the first time that I was gonna have to be out. I was gonna have to show people that this is who I am, that I couldn't hide, that I was an amputee. 

I got out there and I started running and I realized I love to do this. This is so liberating. This is so freeing, because I am out and this is who I am. 

I don't think you ever get one moment, have one experience and you totally accept everything about who you are. That's a life long journey. But the start of that is finding something that allows you to be you.",3,3

So I spend a lot of time looking, observing, learning everything we can about the species and about what their needs are to give them many choices in their environment. So that they have varied days and they have a very dynamic environment that they're living in. 

When I was five years old, I had an encounter with a dolphin. And I was able to look that animal in the eye and that was it for me. I wanted to dedicate my life to working with animals. When I left college, I thought, I'm ready. Put me in a job, I know what to do. 

And what I found was the animals were the best teachers. They have taught me humility. I think that's a big one. They've taught me compassion, to be a little bit more open and be very understanding. Especially to other human beings. 

That was something I learned when I left college. I had amazing experiences in college and I loved my classes but I don't think I really started becoming well rounded until I got out of the classroom. And I really started learning the real world stuff.

214,1459,"Based off of probability, I shouldn't be where I am today. Growing up on the Arizona-Mexico border, I was in this kind of homogenous community that was infested with crime, poverty, and drugs. I applied for the Bill Gates scholarship, and I received that scholarship. If I didn't receive that scholarship, I may have not been where I am today. 

In college, I was majoring in finance and the easiest thing I knew to do was go to work in New York at a finance bank. I realized, wow, the glam of this and the prestige that I was going after is not exactly what I wanted. And then I had a friend who said they were interning at Google. They painted this picture. And I'm like this sounds like Disneyland compared to what I'm doing. 

So when I came to Google, I felt more comfortable here. And it aligned more to my values. My entire job is trying to increase the number of diverse owned businesses that Google is working with to drive economic impact. So if I can do my part in trying to generate more opportunities, more access to opportunities, then that is my way of thinking about it, making sure that I'm doing right, and not forgetting the voice of people who aren't at the table.",2,2
215,146,"Recently I got my car serviced. I noticed the air conditioner wasn't blowing cool air. So I took it to a chain mechanic company near my location. After the car was checked, I was quoted a price of a major part that needed fixing with work needed. I decided to go ahead with getting it done, since AC is something we need in the car, especially in summer time. 

The work was done in a few hours, and we went to pick up the car. As we left the shop, my car stalled and wouldn't drive. I had driven out on a main roadway with lots of traffic. Thankfully, we didn't have an accident, and the car behind me was able to stop when I stalled. 

I drove very slowly around the block back to the shop and informed them of the problem. They checked and apparently had not tightened or adjusted a part well, which caused the issue. I was very disappointed and let them know that their error could have caused an accident or worse. 

However, I was glad they were able to adjust it quickly and then we were on our way. I often think about what happened and how it may have turned out badly. Thankfully, nothing major happened. It was quite a scare.",2,2
216,1461,"I heard about an opportunity in Tanzania to volunteer and work with an organization that was really trying to make an impact with people who are living with HIV. I was offered a position to run the organization that I volunteered at. A really pivotal moment for me was when I came back, I had my first daughter. At six weeks, I brought her back to Africa, and was on the road, and trying to figure how to navigate through childcare. 

One of my colleagues said it was very irresponsible of me to get pregnant. And that was, to this injustice, fire in me. But I packed up my family from Africa and moved. I guess there was the question of why the US. I just figured the US has childcare figured out. So I just had no idea how broken the system was here, until I started pulling on the thread. 

And the piece that I really honed in on was, there's a really magical experience with that, the in-home family. It became really clear that if I wanted my kid to experience the change that I was gonna create, I had to start immediately. And so that is the injustice that I'm really trying to correct. 

I buzz when I'm with people and teams who are trying to solve big problems. Every morning I wake up thinking about the problem and wanna jump out of bed and get started solving it.",3,3
217,1465,"I went to school, because I loved coding and I wanted to develop a coding career. I reached out to a band I liked and said, hey, long shot, but could I make you guys a website? To my surprise, they emailed back ten minutes later. They're like yeah, actually, we'd really love for you to make us a website. How about two t-shirts and a CD in trade for it and I thought that was a great bargain. So I made them a website. 

I did my first or my second website for two t-shirts and a CD. So technically, not a fair market trade. But at the time, the value proposition for me was way higher. You've gotta choose your shots. You will definitely do things in the course of your career that will be undervalued and the trick is to choose the right ones, and to not do it too much. 

Throughout your career and in particular in those formative stages, you've got to go the extra mile. You've gotta work really hard. There's just no shortcut to it. Every now and then, one in a million gets lucky and everybody else who's ever achieved some great level of success has worked incredibly hard to get there.",2,2

Most of the times people say, I wanna be a football player, whatever, movie star, it doesn't work out. In my case it worked out, but I was lucky that way. Astronomy, before I went to college, was something I really thought I could do. 

But I just doubt myself a lot. It's inevitable. When you're trying to push yourself, there are always moments when you think, maybe this is too hard , maybe I can not do it. But my answer to that is that, if you don't feel that way, it means you're not pushing yourself enough. If you never go out of your comfort zone, then you're not really trying very hard. It's part of learning and part of growing up , is figuring out things that you didn't know you could do, and then you do them. 

Sometimes you fail. Sometimes you succeed. First of all, in research most of what you do, fails miserably, because you're trying to do something that nobody knows how to do. So you have to really like failure. Embrace failure. Accept that failure is gonna be part of the process.",3,3

And so I just have really come to love it and I think as I've gotten older, I value it even more and more. Teaching has become a bigger and bigger part of my life. 

I can't say there was like some grand design. There certainly wasn't. I'm not one of those people who saw my future with precision and was simply going down a path with clarity. That's just not the way I was. And in fact when I was doing my PhD was the worst. Because I had gone to business school. People I graduated with from business school are out there in the world making money and I was not. Like I was studying economics. And so that was when I questioned myself the most.

Myself and my children ranging from 5 to 25 all drove together the 7 hours to his town. We visited him in the hospital and he was able to see and spend time with his family. I felt very emotional. I had so many regrets of the years he missed in mine and their lives. I felt fear. 

My father told me that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. I saw all the hope I have always had that one day He would be a dad and grandfather disappear. I have spent my life filled with this hope that one day he will come and love me and be a dad. 

We visited the next day and we came back home. The next week my dad was hospitalized again and then was being sent home with hospice. I set up care for my children and family, and I drove to my father. I brought him home. 

I got to spend one week with my father. I was his daughter. I was his caretaker. I know in detail every regret he has ever had, I know his pain, and he knows mine.

And had I known that software was a career that was an obtainable thing for me to do, I would have hands down done it much earlier. 

But I think also even when I was in school, the idea of computer science classes just seemed really intimidating. From a distance, it looks so complex. But then if you actually learn how to code, it's like, every line is actually very simple. 

Pretty much I just sunk my teeth in and was like, I gotta just do it until I make it happen. And so from then on, as a professional software engineer, you're building stuff everyday.

In the measure that we've started to this, what we're doing is we're beginning to directly and deliberately engineer evolution to do what we want it to do. We want tomatoes to taste this way, we want cows to give this much milk, we want mosquitoes to inject you with vaccines. 

That is the biggest single change going on out there. It means we're gonna generate entirely new fields of research, entirely new jobs, entirely new industries.

I had these ideas of what I wanted to do. Fresh ground coffee, some good food, space, music, and all of that. And I walked around asking different owners of different establishments, ""Can I do this? Do I have what it takes?'' I've never even done business before. 

At the very last moment, I had already even gotten a loan to start my own restaurant. And the very last people I went to were the owners of the Delta of Venus. I asked them, ""I think I want to start a restaurant. Do you have any advice?''

I was marketing analyst and enjoyed playing with numbers and looking for trends. I really liked helping my clients grow their companies. So, it came as a surprised when my boss told me I was being let go. 

The agency I worked for was doing well financially and they had to cut back on expenses. I knew they were having a tough time but I never thought it would affect me. I assumed if they had to lay anyone off it would be newer hires and not people like me who had been with the company for years. 

I was really disappointed and surprised. Now I'm left trying to find a new job but it's possible I might look into a new career path. Finding a new job hasn't been as easy as I thought it would. I have a part time job now and I'm struggling to pay the bills. I still have some savings left but it's starting to dry up. 

Things are starting to look pretty grim and I'm really afraid. There's a part of me who thinks I should go back to school and try a new career but I can't afford to go back to school. So for right now I'm stuck and I'm trying to figure what to do next. Whatever it is I have to figure out something soon.",2,2
226,1485,"I'm a casting director. I say that I am a writer, producer, actor, sometimes casting director, even though that's my day job. But the thing about the film industry is everything is a game. 

When I moved back to Atlanta, I was gonna be an actor again. No longer gonna be a casting director , and then I got offered Magic Mike Two at the time as it was known. But when I came to Savannah to rebook local Savannah actors, I couldn't cast a single person. 

It became so clear at that point that somebody's gotta come in and teach these people exactly what I said in the article. You need classes, you need to learn. 

And I've spent the better part of a year and a half serving my community, and being of service to other people, and mentoring people, and teaching. But it's now time for me to do my own thing. 

A lot of things in my life have kind of changed. I felt more confident in my work, I felt more confident in who I was as a person. And I started becoming a little more outspoken about things, which was not appreciated by some people that you work with, but the higher ups appreciated it.",2,2
227,1487,"It's hard to become a veterinarian. It's competitive. It's eight years of school, and it's expensive. I had to take on a ton of school loans to be able to get through it. That first year of undergrad, it just seemed like I don't know what I wanna do, but this just seems so uphill and I'm looking at a lot of debt if I go through with this. Even in the best case scenario, I'm gonna take on loans and scholarships. 

You pause all the time and you kinda revisit it. What are the things that really make me happy? And ultimately, it was that I want to work with animals. Maybe someday I'm gonna work with an animal that could be going extinct, or is gonna be endangered. Or I'm gonna be working in a place where, if we're not doing something, things are gonna change, and the world's not gonna be as good. 

And I think what I learned about choosing to come to work here is that, you're going to be the happiest at the place that kind of best aligns with who you think you are and what you really want to be. And I found that drive towards animals was the most aligned with my heart than anywhere else I had worked or wanted to work.",2,2
228,1488,"I remember being 18, trying to figure out what degree to study. And I still remember it, on the lower right-hand side of the Detroit Free Press, on the front page, they listed the highest starting salaries. Chemical engineer was at the top. So I said, I guess I'll do that. I decided to find a job using my degree. When I got to apply the skills I learned at school, I actually enjoyed it. I realized that I like this, and I figured out how to apply my skills. 

I went back to graduate school, and then ended up getting a job in Grand Rapids, Michigan for one of Herman Miller Suppliers. 13 years later, I'm still here. And it's amazing to be part of an organization that tries to live up to its values every day. We don't always succeed. But by and large, every day I come in, and my team's job is to ask the question, have I made the best choice possible and look for innovative ways to make the world a better place? 

I think that's so important, finding a company where you feel comfortable and they share this common set of values. If you land in a good company, the opportunities will open up. I've never been focused on the next promotion. It's all about getting immersed in my work and doing the best job that I can. And generally, good things have worked out from there.",2,2
229,1489,"I run a collective woodshop. We are home to about eight furniture makers who make their living making furniture in the shop here. And we also teach woodworking classes. Most people think I make my living making furniture, but most of my time is spent managing the woodshop. 

My whole family has this ethic of working with their hands and being able to do things for themselves. And that's something that I grew up with and I saw, and it's not something that I had in my jobs. I was finding myself in jobs where I was behind computers, I was on the phone. I thought the work was very important, but at the end of the day, I wasn't very happy with how my time was spent during the day. 

And so I eventually took a year off, moved up to Northern California. Went to the Krenov School. It's a year-long certificate program on furniture making. That's kind of how I got into woodworking. It's something that keeps me feeling like I'm connected to my family and my roots. 

So be introspective, and do some soul-searching and think about what your strengths are, what it is that you love to do, and figure out if there's a way to turn that into your career path.",2,2
230,149,"To celebrate my retirement earlier this year, my husband and I went on a cruise to Alaska. We left out of Seattle, Washington. We live in New York and had to fly across the country. It was the first time we were both on an airplane and it was both exciting and nerve-wracking as we were flying in the same day the ship was leaving Seattle. 

We arrived at Seattle with no delays and met our transport at the airport. It was approximately 30 to 45 minute ride to get to the ship. I'll never forget the sight of the ship - it was so much bigger than I could have imagined. We had to wait a little while to board the ship and there was not much to do...but finally, we were able to board. 

The ship was so large - like a little city. We found our room, dropped off some stuff and then went to get some food. They were serving burgers and fries at one of the eateries. We waited in line, there were a lot of people. The food was not great but we figured it was due to the number of people being served and they were rushing to serve as many as possible. The food throughout the cruise was hit and miss...but mostly very good. At least, if we did not like something, we could go back and get something else. 

The cruise was a once in a lifetime experience. We got to see so much beautiful scenery and we had 4 stops on land. Glacier Bay was spectacular, a sight I will never forget. We saw glaciers calving...it was awesome. The trip was an experience I will never forget.",2,2
231,1497,"I thought I was gonna be a professional dancer. I'd come home at 10 PM and I would be really tired physically and mentally, and I just kind of decided, I don't wanna do that any more. I transitioned into creative writing and, probably one of the best decisions I ever made in my life, because ultimately that led me here. 

This was the second job I applied to, out of 43 jobs. I get to make sure that the products that come to me are in a very specific format, that I can make sure it gets all of the approvals from all of the people they need to get approvals from. 

Ultimately I still use my dance skills. One of the main things we learned about was improvisation. I use that all the time. I got to be the most nit-picky grammar nerd ever. They let me talk about hyphens and dashes like nobody's business. 

When it comes down to like, you have to take this path or whatever to be an engineer or an architect or a scientist or a writer or literary agent or an actor or anything like that, I don't see a lot of people who do that.",2,2
232,1498,"I am co-founder and CEO of a company called Commit. I come from a non-entrepreneurial, almost not even business-focused background. I started school in the mindset of I wanna be a doctor. When I got to college, I sat there and I'm like, okay, going into medicine is a huge commitment. It's actually not really something that drives me. In school, I realized that what made me really happy and passionate and motivated me was working in teams to solve problems. That kind of was really nebulous for me at the time of how you turn that into a career, until I found consulting. It didn't force me to choose one career, it allowed me to continue exploring, and trying different things. 

I did not think I was ever going to be an entrepreneur. I left consulting to go to school, get my Masters. Commit started while I was still in school. I graduated less than two months ago, and have been working on my startup full time since then. I'm 28 now and I still haven't answered for myself, what do I wanna be when I grow up? 

As long as you just don't close a door and burn a bridge, the options will always be there.",1,1
233,15,"Several weeks ago, my friends asked me if I would give up my job to be a nanny for their children. One of which is special needs. I have worked at my position for 7 years. I love my coworkers. My hours are great. The commute is easy. Salary is generous. I enjoy what I do, although the changes in society post covid have really taken a toll. Being talked down to by a stranger is now a daily thing and as much as you let it slide off your shoulders, it does grate you down each time. 

Several weeks ago, while visiting with our friends and their family, they asked me if I'd be willing to leave my job to become their nanny full time. Their youngest requires several in home therapy sessions each week and that requires a family member to be there because it's in the home and not at a daycare.Because of my relationship with the family, I qualify as being his aunt and can be the point person for therapy. They were willing to pay my current salary plus gas expenses. 

Today I let my supervisor know that October 12 would be my last day. I thought I'd be there until I was ready to retire. I'm still in a little state of shock that I bit the bullet and said yes. I'm excited and honored by my friend's trust that I can keep their precious little dude safe and be reactive to any health emergencies that might come his way. 

I'm hoping it works out for everyone. Leaps of faith are so scary!",3,3
234,1500,"I wanted to be an artist when I was in high school, but I actually started in nursing school. We were really poor, and my dad died when I was six, and I saw my mom struggle working in a sewing factory. I thought, well this is crazy to be a starving artist. I better do something practical. So I went to school for nursing. 

Photography and me was a better fit. So, I started at the Miami Herald as a staff photographer, just from there moved on to do international stories, so I bounced around a lot. I traveled a whole lot. 

When you can capture a moment, capture history, preserve that second of time, that's meaningful in some way. If it makes you feel, it's probably gonna make someone else feel too. But those were the moments that I always look for. I feel like there's all different types of photography that you have to appreciate. 

You can do all these stylized beautiful perfectly composed pictures, but for me, journalism, I think the only thing that matters is the content in the moment and making someone feel. Because you can make someone think, but to make someone feel is the ultimate goal. 

The more you can do to connect people, the less hatred there will be in the world, the more understanding there will be.",2,2
235,1501,"Despite having a low income background, my mom fought to make sure I had a a high income education. So I went to some good schools, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Northwestern University for law school, and it hasn't been easy. Even as an undergrad, I had to pay my way through after not having the capability to do my financial aid stuff right and doing poorly and my brother passing away when I was in college. 

And the jokes that grown kids were making jokes and I was waiting tables, working a lot of jobs. Folks calling me all sorts of names and saying, aren't you gonna wait on me today? Are you sure you're not working today? You need to be waiting on me. 

One of the things I was grateful for is I always had a glimpse of what life was going to be like for my family and I, and it wasn't gonna be a one-way struggle my whole life. As long as I stay focused and paid attention to the right things, I would be all right. 

Now it's painful, of course, being made fun of by classmates for wearing hand me down clothes and stuff from Goodwill and all that. Studying by candlelight, because you didn't have the lights. You have to know deep down that whatever's going on in your life is not gonna be your story, that's just gonna be a chapter.",3,3
236,1502,"I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas, born and raised. Little Rock in the 90s was on the top five crime lists and murder rate lists in the country. It was a bad time for that city. I never felt like I belonged there. I just felt like this isn't right. 

I decided to change my life. And I didn't really know all the ways how yet, but I knew not being in Little Rock needed to be a part of it. Little Rock is too small , but I was nervous that I might not be ready to go to New York, or LA. So a mid size city. Looking for a low crime rate, and trend in technology upward. And Seattle was that place. 

I do think that one of the most powerful things in the world is understanding what you want, and just trying to figure out how to focus on that. Just today, not forever, not in ten years, because you'll be different in five years. You just are how you are now. And knowing what you want right now is the thing that should drive what you're doing. 

I've been able to do that, and I've been very successful and it's not because I'm special. It's just because I focused on what I wanted.",2,2
237,1504,"I always knew I wanted to do journalism since I was a little kid. I was writing for my school paper in fifth grade. But by the time I graduated, I still didn't know if I wanted to do newspaper, or if I wanted to do TV and I ended up doing TV. 

And I just really enjoy talking to people. I feel like that was why I wanted to do journalism, because everyone's so different, everybody has different stories, and people are just interesting. I love watching TV, I like watching TV, but I never really thought about the possibilities of working in TV. 

It's just been such an amazing experience. It's a hard job, but it's really rewarding. I think it's a dream job that I didn't realize I had. 

I don't always know if I'm making the right decision while I'm making them. I feel sometimes, am I stunting myself in my career? Am I where I'm supposed to be right now? Am I doing all that I can to get to the next point? But you don't always know if you're doing the right thing, but it works out. 

I feel like things just work themselves out.",2,2
238,1508,"One of the things my parents always taught me was to always take pride in your work, regardless if it's cleaning toilets. Even though I was working just at the mall, I still took a lot of pride in work and being a holiday cashier. Eventually they kept me on, it ended up being something I fell in love with. 27 years later, I'm still here. 

When I left my hometown I was 21. I was moving to Los Angeles, I had just finished college. My aunt was talking very negatively about my decision, you're gonna fail, you're gonna come back crawling, anything you can imagine that would be demotivating. I didn't talk back to her, but I internalized a lot of her negativity and processed it more as empowerment. 

It's interesting because many years later the whole family knows what I do for a living now and even she has said I am so proud of you. And I said to her, you're part of the reason that I made it, because your non-belief in me actually pushed me just as hard as the people that did believe in me. 

So don't ever let anyone that doesn't believe in you affect your strength, just channel that energy in a very positive way.",2,2
239,1511,"Bret and I were always interested in breaking things. We would go to pay phones and cut the wire, then go back later and clip it back and get all the change that it saved up and do stuff like that. I think that's probably what really motivated me to go into how can I make this a career? I switched my major five times. After that I got into some physical security and did some physical stuff for a while. And then got into federal and state and local and then convinced them to let me do some testing. And that's where all the professional hacker stuff started coming into play. 

And with that experience it opened up doorways to other things. So eventually I got on at Solutionary and went and got Bret on and we're still doing the same thing we did when we were 13 years old, but doing it without the risk of getting arrested. I said it was always a hobby, but it was also my dream job, but at the time I wasn't really sure how to make that switch, because I didn't necessarily go to college specifically for that. I didn't get a degree in computer science. I actually got a degree in graphic design. 

And once I got to a certain level, a friend let me know that where he worked at Solutionary was hiring and it just kind of went from there. So one day I was a web and graphic designer and project manager and then the next day I was a security consultant.",1,1

That was my first interaction as an outpatient with a physical therapist. From there all the way to high school the goal in the head was that was definitely what I was gonna be. 

I decided to go to college and in my junior year going into my senior year, I took a human genetic course for non science majors. And I was in heaven. I also got involved with the research and I figured why not give it a try? So I decided to the research, still doing both. In the end I had to pick one and research was the one I decided to pick. 

We're all young when we start our journeys out. For some of us it's delayed and then we finally come to it after working. But it's always gonna be changing depending on what you experience. You just gotta go whatever the wind blows your way, because you might miss an opportunity. 

If I just said research, forget it, then I would have missed where I am today,",2,2

My parents advised me, you have three choices with your career, you can either be a doctor, or a lawyer, or an engineer. And thank God I chose engineer, because I fell in love with it. 

I didn't think about going to an insurance industry. I had specific companies in mind that I wanted to work for related to chemical engineering. But then, when I stumbled upon FM Global, I was immediately hooked that I get to work with different risk managers and different facilities. So I thought that was the best opportunity that I could give myself to open my horizon a little bit. 

So what I am doing now is heading up the cyber unit here in FM Global to make sure that we have the adequate engineering products and services so that we can offer our clients the best risk management solutions for cyber. 

So we have been burning things up in a lab. We do explosions , we do shake tables for an earthquake , we fill rooms with water to test our flood barriers. But it's really time now to come up with a tool to help our clients to mitigate cyber risk as well. So I'm really excited to be part of that innovation team just to start up something new.",2,2
242,152,"I went to my cousin's wedding last month. It was important to me because we grew up together in the same house for a period of time and it was a major milestone for her. It was in Toronto, Canada and there were over 100 guests there. I also got to see extended family together for the first time in years. 

We first went to a wedding rehearsal before the event. It was at a Chinese restaurant and the food was really good. Then we went to a castle for the actual day of the wedding. First, I got to see them walk down the aisle. Then, I got to see the official formalize the event and watch them dance. 

Then, we went to a reception. I got to hear speeches from many people that marked what an important event it was. The funniest speech was when they shared each other's many embarrassing secrets. It made the event lighter but also showed how much they knew and cared for each other. 

It was my first time at a wedding so it was a cool experience. Mostly I was just happy to see my cousin get married and have such a life-changing event.",2,2
243,1523,"I grew up in Nigeria. But we came from a very entrepreneurial family. And that meant that people were doers. And I believe in life, that you actually have the capacity to do whatever it is you want to do. Nobody else is going to do it. 

There are so many things you see in life that you feel like there's injustice. But often times you just relax and say somebody else is gonna do it. Well that somebody else is you. And you seem very controlled about your own life and very driven. So I'm wondering was there a time when you were less sure about yourself? 

Yes. Okay. Oh yeah. Tell me about that. Computer scientists know nothing ever works the first time, that's the beauty of it. It's a problem solving thing, and so failure is built into the act of learning. You have to like trip and trip, and trip, and trip. 

And then, once you figure out all the ways you can trip, you finally learn how to walk. It's little baby steps to build that muscle of courage and confidence. Just take a deep breath, and just tell your feet to move, and your feet will move.",2,2
244,1528,"I grew up with a mom as an artist. She was a landscape photographer, so every summer for about one month we would travel somewhere fairly remote. We started just going to different places in the United States, and when I was 10 or 11, we started leaving the country every year. That gave me this time and space for a month at least every year to soak up nature. 

I traveled to Greenland in 2006 for the first time with my family, and at the time, climate change was really not a topic of discussion here in the United States, as it is today. I just didn't realize how huge of a crisis it was, and it made me realize I wanted to focus my work on those issues. 

Climate change is such a distant concept for most of us, because it's not happening in our everyday lives. It's like this slow train wreck and it disengages us. You get scared, and shocked, and overwhelmed, and then you don't know what to do. 

A lot of studies have shown that we make decisions, and we take actions based on our emotions more than anything else. You can write the word glacier and you can describe it. If you see an image of a glacier it's an experience.

I think I wasted a lot of time expecting there to be some sort of white light moment where, oh the sky is parted and now I'm inspired and I'm gonna work for two weeks straight and get this thing done. It's so easy to be like, well I'm not inspired today, I'll go do something else. But you have got to put the work in. You've still got to structure yourself. 

I spent so much of my 20s being like, when is the magic gonna strike or something like that. Time is short, and there's gonna be no magic moment where you're like, now is the time to do it. Like that's just not gonna happen. No one's gonna come to the rescue and say all right, that dream you have, we're gonna start now.

I applied for the program assistant position in performing arts, and I have museum experience, I have my anthro background, I have theater. It just kind of came together, and it was totally unplanned. 

The thing is, I never knew a job like what I have now existed or could exist. I just sort of positioned myself with things that really felt right. It's really a matter of instinct on some level and a broad plotting of things. 

I've felt just pretty open about how the future will pan out. Your path is what you make of it. There are positions out there, there are careers out there that you can fit into. But there also things that you can make yourself and you have to just trust that you have something unique to offer and to be consistent with that in your choices.",2,2
247,1536,"June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. 

We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. 

My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 

4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. 

My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us.

There was a dichotomy in the household, with my sisters being accomplished and beautiful, while I was sickly and a bookworm who stayed at home all the time. My brother was the only one who was there for me, always making time for me even though he was eleven years older. Every Saturday afternoon, we would watch The Three Stooges and horror movies on TV. He made me feel special. The song ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" reminds me of him the most. I attended his high school graduation when I was only seven years old, and after receiving his diploma, he was drafted to go to Vietnam. The song by Peter, Paul, and Mary became a poignant reminder of my brother for my mother and me. Despite being bullied and sad, he brought sunshine into my life, spending time with me and showing me love. The song always made my mother and me cry. Thankfully, I am a lot better now, but I wanted to share this story to introduce myself and show how much my brother meant to me. Thank you for letting me share.",3,3
249,1538,"Well, I'm going to tell you since my last story was kind of modeling, I will tell you a funny story. My husband and I lived in Florida for quite some time, and we were on the beach. There was a brand of suntan lotion that I had used before, and it was like 15 or 18 SPF that we used all the time. We put it on and stayed out from about 10:00 a.m. We broke for lunch around noon and then remained out for another 3 hours. We noticed people looking at us really strangely. So we couldn't figure it out. I said, ""I'm going to go to the restroom and see if I look funny or anything."" And he said, ""Me too."" So I looked in the mirror and I said, ""Oh, my God."" And I heard from the other bathroom him exclaimed the same thing, ""Oh my God."" And what had happened is I had grabbed tanning accelerator instead of tanning lotion, and we were as red as lobsters. So long story short, if you are going to be in the Gulf of Mexico suntanning, you should make sure you're using proper suntanning lotion. Okay? That's it.",2,2
250,1539,"Okay, I was married when I was young, and unfortunately, my first husband had a heart attack at a young age. I had two young children to take care of and hadn't dated or been out with anybody for years. As my children were growing up - my son was in college and my daughter was 16 - she decided she liked heavy music and wanted to go to Ozzfest in Georgia. So, a friend of hers, the mother, and I drove them to Atlanta for the event.

While I was getting something to drink for the other mother and myself, I saw a man with the most beautiful hair I'd ever seen. I told him, ""You have the most beautiful hair of anyone I've ever seen. Excuse me."" He responded graciously, ""Well, thank you. You look like you totally don't belong here."" We laughed and chatted a bit before I returned to my seat. Later on, I noticed he was on stage performing with a band. I had no idea he was a musician. After his set, he approached me and asked, ""Do you have an email?"" I gave him my address, and we started corresponding. Two years later, we got married. He's my current husband, and that strange day at Ozzfest turned out to be one of the happiest days of my life. That's how I met my husband - he was playing at Ozzfest.",2,2
251,154,"A few months ago.. maybe 3 to be exact I had applied for a new promotion at work. I was so worried that I would not get it. So many people applied for this position. The hours were better, the pay was better, and even the benefits were better. The only thing is you would be working a lot harder and you would be dealing with many more problems on a daily. 

It came time for the interviews. I remember my interview and how nervous I was. I was certain I completely failed at the interview. I can remember about 10 other people waiting to be interviewed for this position as I left the room. I walked to my car with tears streaming down my face. I was thinking there is no way you got this. Just keep trying for something else. This wasn't meant for you. 

I had all of these negative feelings and I really had no reason too. I had just as good of a chance as everyone else that was trying to get the position. I remember later that night I was home cooking dinner when I got the call confirming that I was the one who got the job. 

Still to this day I can not put into words how happy and proud I am of myself. I did this. Nobody else. I am just as worthy as anyone else. Never put yourself down you got this too.",3,3
252,1540,"So yeah, I can share a story that happened recently. I went to Yosemite with my boyfriend two weeks ago to see one of the biggest meteor showers during the year, and that was very fascinating. It was my first time seeing so many meteors at one time. A part of the sky was covered by clouds, so we couldn't see meteors throughout all the areas in the sky, but at least through a specific small area we have seen a lot of meteors. I was pretty satisfied. I was also very grateful for my boyfriend waking up so early at 3:00 a.m. and driving us up to Glacier Point in Yosemite to catch the sunrise, which is very beautiful, although I was still sleeping while he was driving. Afterwards, we went on a little hike to Mirror Lake. However, once we got there, it started to rain. The Mirror Lake was supposed to be very smooth on its surface so that it looks like a mirror, but because of the raining, the mirror was kind of rough. So it was a numb mirror, Mirror Lake. But we still got a little exercise by hiking towards it, so it was still very fun. After that, we went home. It was a pretty fun trip that I wanted to share with you.",2,2
253,1542,"Guys, so today I was watching an episode of Suits, and in Suits, there is a lawyer named Louis. The whole thing is a TV show that takes place in New York, in a law office. Louis is one of the lawyers who is constantly trying to be the best, and he always sees himself as inferior to Harvey, another character. And every time Louis tries to do some kind of payback for whatever Harvey did to him, it always ends up backfiring on him somehow. He always makes a bigger mess than what he started. What kind of resonated with me in this story is that it's not necessarily the greatest objective to try and be the best. Because if you are trying to be better than someone else, you're constantly competing and trying to undermine them or go against them. And while it can be healthy, to some extent, to have some competition, unhealthy competition doesn't make a lot of sense, and that kind of resonated with me. Because for so long, I competed in competitions for everything from math to science to robotics. And it was always like you had to be the best. And now, going past college, it doesn't make sense to try and be the best because everyone is doing something completely different from you. So just keep trying and undermining people will just backfire on you.",2,2
254,1545,"So, I guess here, the fact is, I'm not a huge fan of the work that I had to do in this past year for my research, but I did it anyway because I was being paid to do it. And now I'm almost done, I've switched over to a new strain of work that I am interested in, but I still have to wrap up the last bits of my old work by writing a paper. I really can't find any of the motivation to do it because I did not like the work at all. But this is the only way to prove that I did any work in the entirety of the last year. So, I guess, the main thing I'm learning here is, there is a challenge there. I don't want to work on it, I have no motivation to work on it, but I need to get it done. So if anything, I'm kind of completing it out of spite. It seems that spite is a pretty good reason to keep going because it's just to prove someone else wrong, that thought that you couldn't. I'm taking it as motivation to do something I really am not motivated to do, to prove others that I was wrong, to prove others that they were wrong about me.",2,2
255,1548,"""Yeah, so my sister is writing this story, and the preliminary title, or the current title, is ""Wonders for the Dead."" It's a really interesting story. Her and I had talked about it and kind of brainstormed together because it's based off the idea of Christian missionaries. But it's trying to take an ethical perspective or like a thoughtful perspective on the idea of someone being a missionary and bringing the idea of like, why would someone want to be a missionary? And so I read this story today to offer some edits or some critiques. Basically, the story goes, it starts out this little girl named Annalore is on a train with her mother and her two siblings, traveling from, we don't know exactly where, but they're going to a citadel. The train stops because they need to do some train work. They see three undead, or how they're called, dead. The little girl sees three of the dead wearing ragged clothes and asks her mother, like, ""mama, is that one of the dead?"" And her mother's trying to sleep, so her mother tells her like, ""Be quiet, leave me alone."" Then the dead race for the train, jump in, trying to find somebody to bite or somebody to eat. Everyone's panicking, there's like a stampede. The main character was in the woman's train compartment and all the men run into that compartment, hiding, trying to get away, obviously slam the door closed. Just this little boy and this old man left with the dead chasing them. The little boy manages to open a window and jumps out, the old man is waving his cane at the dead, trying to get out, trying to escape, they grab him, start biting, ripping him to pieces. The little girl is just watching, her mother told her, stay still, sit, don't look. She sees this man get killed very violently. Then the train workers come with guns, ""you better leave this train or else we're going to blow you to Kingdom Come."" The dead say, ""You should be scared of me. What are you doing?"" But the workers say, ""we'll shoot you if you don't leave."" Finally, they leave, dragging the body away. The girl is horrified, flash forward maybe ten years later, she's trying to buy a gun in the store. The store owner asks her, ""Is this gun for your father?"" She says, ""no, this is not for my father."" He asks, ""Are you sure?"" She says, ""yes, my father looks for all of his women folk to be well armed."" The store owner decides to sell her the gun, tried to sell her a bad gun she knew better. She takes her gun, all the materials for her father's store, she takes it over there. The store clerk flirts with her, she leaves to check the mail she's waiting for. The mail is late, everyone starts freaking out. The Sheriff says, ""no, the dead haven't attacked our train in ages, it's fine."" She's horrified, the mail arrives late, everyone's excited. They ask the man holding packages, ""Did the dead attack the train?"" They think he's one of the dead, she fires her rifle, calms everyone down. She asks for her package, waiting for a response to join the lazari to help deal with the dead. That's the beginning of the story, pretty interesting.""",2,2
256,155,"Last month, I took a solo camping trip to the local state forest managed by the DEC. It was a great way to get away from the family, and I was very thrilled to be doing so. I brought my larger tent, as I felt the 2-man tent was not going to cut it. I had to find a clearing in the woods so that I could place it, and there was a nice spot about 300 feet in from the road. However, it was overshadowed by a 25 foot dead pine tree that was in the process of falling over. I pulled out my axe and helped it, knocking it down in about 10 minutes of work. I had to use my saw in certain parts due to the way the tree was angled. 

Once I finally got it down, I had plenty of firewood at my disposal, right next to my camp! I proceeded to de-limb the tree for kindling, and then sawed the larger main trunk of the tree for actual firewood. After clearing the area for about an hour, I now had a nice flat place to put my tent. I pitched my tent after sweeping the area with a few branches. When that was done, I decided to scour the area for large stones so that I could build a fire pit. I found about a dozen decent sized stones and carried them back to the campsite. I dug a small pit and arranged the stones around it, a wonderful start to my camping trip. 

From that point on, it was basically cooking, enjoying the scenery, and being along with my thoughts. I did some scouting around the area and found a very old graveyard, which I estimated to be at least 140 years old! The strange thing is that it was on top of a mountain, so someone had to come up here to build it. I feel it was an appropriate place, as the area was quite beautiful and had a wonderful view. 

I really enjoyed my camping trip up in the woods and got some much needed relaxation and time to myself, without the chattering of my wife and children to distract me. I plan on doing this again and cannot wait until my next trip.",2,2
257,1551,"""Yeah, so I think something I've been thinking about lately is this book that I've been reading, called ""The Way of the Wanderer."" Basically, it's about a war between ten dogs, with one of the gods being the wandering God and another god being the God of Law. The God of Law is trying to become the only God by wanting to be the law, but the wandering God wants to prevent that because the wanderer doesn't want to be free. To prevent the God of Law from becoming the only God, the wandering God starts uniting the tribes of people that worship him and working with other gods to combine their worshippers to be stronger than the God of Law. Currently, in the part of the book that I'm reading, there are genies, particularly one genie, who is determined to be the best and smartest genie and wants to be honored by the wandering God. He's playing all sides to impress the wandering God, pitting tribe leaders against each other to eventually make it look like he brought everyone together, and working with other deities and spirits from other gods. However, he's not that smart, so I think his plans are going to fail. But I also wonder if they might succeed because they're so messy that they might actually end up being good.""",1,1
258,1553,"""Yeah. So, as I mentioned before, I started reading this book called 'Unearthly Gorgeous' by Ocean Vaughn, and actually, Ocean Vaughn came to my school. Actually, when I graduated, he spoke at my commencement ceremony. And reading this book made me think about the fact that if I had read this book a year ago or a year and a half ago, that when Ocean Vaughn came, I would have known him, would have known his work, and something about his life and all these very deeply personal things that he's written about. And I just started to wonder why I didn't discover this book before.""
""But then, I started just like as I was on the train and as I was walking home, really thinking about how I feel since graduating College and all the things that I've done since then, that I have changed a lot in a really quick or really short period of time. And that some of the different books and different things that have been that are just coming to me now have been postponed but I got years ago but didn't start. That maybe they are a part of my current change and the fact that I pick them up again is a part of my current change and will help in the growth that is to come.""
""And yeah, I think just reading this book and the past few months, a lot of things have just been kind of impacting me in a different way. And it's very interesting because there's a lot about it that is philosophical, a lot of it that's mental. Some things are sad, some things that are happy. It's like so many things mixed up together. So, yeah, that's not just one story, but kind of an ongoing story of my current time.""",2,2
259,1554,"Okay. So this is the only story I can think of, and hopefully it'll be a little interesting to you, Jivo. Basically, I met this guy on a train platform a few days ago. He walked up to me and said something like, ""Hi, how are you doing?"" Then he segued the conversation to talking about the difficulty of finding community in Boston. He mentioned, ""Oh, this is where I'm from, blah, blah."" We got on the train, traveled a little bit, and he said, ""Oh, you know, we should chat again as I'm getting off."" He's pretty interesting. A few days ago, we got lunch and chatted for an hour or two. I had already thought, ""Maybe this guy is kind of approaching me because he thinks I'm attractive in some way, just physically.” We had some things in common. But he would always move from what I was most interested in to talking about what he seemed most interested in sharing. Now, he is trying to get me to hang out with him, and we met less than a week ago. So, I'm currently in a place of trying to figure out how to be kind to another person and treat them well without feeling like I owe them anything or have a certain responsibility to do or say or give anything that I don't want to. Yeah, so that's a story for my week.",2,2
260,156,"Three weeks ago as I got back from work, I suddenly noticed my pet dog Molly was missing. I went to tell my wife, but she just said that he would be OK because his name was Molly. That just made me feel worse. I went to tell Dad, but he said the same thing. So I decided to go and look for him myself. 

I looked for him in the garden, but he wasn't there, so I looked in the paddocks where Mum and I had taken him for his walks. Then I went into the back yard to let the other dogs out of their kennels to look for him. I thought they might be able to help me find him, but I couldn't even find him with the other dog's help. So I gave up and put the other dogs back in their kennels, it was getting dark anyway. 

I had my dinner and went to bed. In the middle of the night I heard something scratching on my bedroom door. I got up and turned on the light, and what did I see? I saw Molly. I let him into my bedroom and I hugged him and I patted him. I love my dog Molly, he's the best. I felt relieved and so happy to see him again.",3,3
261,1563,"I have our big leftover from yesterday's birthday party and thought I was going to bring this box of pizza to homeless people who might be hungry. But it reminded me of a certain period of time ago when I saw a homeless man holding a sign that said ""I am hungry"" and ""help me"" and ""God bless you"". I didn't have cash, so I passed him, but went to a pizza store and got a slice or two of pizza for him, and then went back to him and handed the pizza to him. However, he said, ""oh, okay, I'm good. Too much pizza,"" so I ended up giving him the small cash that my husband had. At that time, I didn't have cash, but my husband did. Usually, I feel good when I think I am doing good, but that time, I didn't feel as good because I went to the pizza store for him. Of course, I didn't ask him if he wanted pizza, but I did. So I expected him to say thank you and accept that slice of pizza, but I noticed that the way I wanted to treat the person was not the way he wanted to be treated. I can't expect to be thanked. Yeah, I would take the pizza from yesterday's birthday party because it reminded me of that memory.",2,2
262,157,"One of the most memorable please my life was when I graduated from my graduate school in May 2019. This day which was actually May 16, 2019, was one of the best days of my life for several reasons. Number one, I worked extremely hard to my patient studies to make sure that I graduated in only five years which a lot of people do not do. Because I was able to accomplish this in such a short time, I was extremely proud of myself and I felt that this was one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. 

I spent many nights in many weekends working extremely hard in the laboratory doing homework’s studying and doing very difficult experiments just to make sure that I had all of the data necessary to graduate. My family and I had to make a lot of sacrifices during my five years to make sure that I was going to graduate and finish my degree. My family and I knew that this would be a long-term investment so we put all of our resources into it. 

On that day I feel like I finally had accomplished everything that I want it and I was going to be able to get back to my family. This is why that day was so so significantly memorable for me. I felt that I hadfinally achieved one of my major life goals and my family and I were actually together getting this PhD. 

It is a day that will live on in our family and something that will actually carry-on to other generations. I am the first one in my family to obtain an advanced degree and because of this I know that future generations will actually know that anything is possible. I am looking to inspire future generations of my family and I know that it all starts with my graduation. 

That PhD degree is going to take me anywhere I wantwhich is why I am so happy that I’ll be able to finish it. I am looking to make a big difference in our world and I know that my degree in my education will allow me to do just that. I don’t see work that’s just work but I want to have a job that I can have fun and make a really big impact in the scientific world. 

I now have the opportunity because of this day and this is why this is my entry into one of the most memorable moments of my life especially in the last six months.",3,3
263,1571,"So, I was kind of looking at old pictures but also thinking about pictures from my childhood, and my mom is really embarrassed about herself. She's always been, ever since I can remember. And it's funny because a lot of times in old pictures, I'll see my sister and I or my sister and other people in our family. But it's always weird seeing my mom in old pictures because it's so rare. It's also rare and a little weird feeling, remembering that person who she was because she was so pretty and so young, very, very young, but also so tormented. She has a lot of depression and anxiety. I didn't know what it was as a kid. I remember just not realizing how the situation I was in until getting out and looking back. So, seeing these old pictures of my sister and I kind of just, it's funny to see. It just makes me feel grateful for my sister, for being there when it was a little bit difficult. But also, I feel a little bit lucky that that little girl that was me in the pictures had no idea. I didn't try to wrap my head too far around the struggles that my mom was going through. I kind of just picked up and treaded through all of her stuff that she was trying to put on me. Now I'm a stronger person for it. But looking back at pictures with seeing her in them and knowing what she used to say about herself, it was totally not true. Especially looking back now, it's just a very interesting feeling to see that.",3,3
264,1573,"Okay, so my first summer at Rhode Island School of Design with a D was so fun. I was in for a master's of architecture, but I had to do a summer program since my background wasn't in architecture. It was probably my favorite part of RISD because we took all of the foundation courses with the transfer students who were going to be sophomores. I painted this massive eight feet by eight feet painting for one of the finals, based off an amoeba, but I just liked it because the colors were blue. My sister liked it, so I gave the painting to her before she graduated medical school. When I was moving into an apartment in New Jersey, she wanted to hang up the painting. It was right before I left for somewhere for the summer, but I helped her hang it up in her apartment. It was funny because my sister, who is usually older and a bit bossy, didn't know what we were supposed to do to hang it. I was patient and calm in giving directions, instead of us yelling at each other. After we hung it, she said, ""You are really good at giving directions. I would definitely listen to you. You're so calm and nice."" I replied, ""Yeah, whenever I'm in charge, I'm actually pretty clear and patient with people."" So it's kind of a funny memory.",1,1
265,1574,"My parents have never gotten along; they knew each other for a year, ended up finding out they were pregnant with my sister, and got married. They probably shouldn't have, then had me two years later. They were never happy, and I remember one night where they were fighting. They would have brutal fights, yelling and sometimes it got physical. I was in first grade and woke up to one of these fights. I got out of bed, walked out, and saw my dad on top of my mom, biting her. I went back to my room because I was scared. They were yelling at each other, and then I heard a loud noise. I walked out again, and my mom had locked herself in a room while my dad had punched the door. I asked what was going on, and he said it's okay, go back to bed. I asked why he punched the door, and he just said it's okay. There was a hole in it, and it was really scary. Lots of these situations happened when I was a kid. Through therapy, my sister and I discovered that we're more mad at our mom than our dad because she would instigate a lot of these fights. My dad shouldn't have done those things either, but I hold more of a grudge against my mom because she took it out on us. When they divorced and separated, my mom started treating us like she treated my dad. It took a lot of therapy to not feel like it was my fault.",3,3
266,1575,"Yesterday, whenever I go out with my mom, she's always super negative. She's going to be super negative, talk over me, try to get attention with poor, pitiful me stories. We went to dinner. She tried to jump in, talk over me, and make the whole dinner about her. She always talks about her teaching job which is always negative, and it's always about her. I told a story that included my boyfriend and her, and she just jumped in and tried to tell a version of it that was not true. She came over to my house, asked me to walk her out to her car. I tried to just walk her to the door because she always has to have attention. She started crying, which is really annoying because I feel like she puts all of her happiness on me. We had a calm conversation where I explained that I can't be her therapist. Today, she sent me a text message kind of blaming me for not wanting to see her. I'm really annoyed with her for always putting her negative attitude on me. It makes me scared that she'll kill herself sometimes. I'm kind of done with it. I choose not to be upset about adversity and problems. She just wants pity, and it's so annoying.",3,3
267,1576,"Okay, so this one is where I feel like I was in the wrong and analyzing it. From my dad's side, I have a whole lot of anger and my mom's side is a short temper. As a kid, my mom was verbally abusive and physically abusive. When I was in second or third grade, I watched her pick up my sister by the throat and throw her across the room. I would try to stop things from happening and one time I stood up to her, she tried to grab my arm. That's the same night she threw me across the room by the neck and I was like, I was in second grade, I was tiny. At that point, I realized, I can't help. I'm too small of a human to stop this and my words don't matter. But all of that aside, I've processed that I think, though I do feel bad about, is my dad lived in Dallas. He got remarried to my stepmom and my stepmom had already had a daughter who's my stepsister. She was three years younger than me and she was okay, just from a different, chaotic household, not quite like mine. She was also manipulative and would say mean things. My stepmom has always been defensive of her, which is fine. When I was in elementary school, my stepsister said something really mean and hurtful and nobody ever let her held accountable. I got mad and I told her to stop, she wouldn't stop. I did what my mom did, I picked her up by her neck, my dad and stepmom saw, they got mad at me. I mean, of course, I shouldn't have done that. I'd watched my mom do it and I had learned that behavior. They yelled at me and to this day, still don't let me forget it. I've told them that I'm sorry, I was just angry and shouldn't have done that. I've apologized a thousand times, but they won't let me forget it. I did try to say she wasn't the easiest, she would say really hurtful and mean things, and nobody was, they said she didn't do that, she was too young to do that. She's always kind of been that way even as we've gotten older. She's always been selfish and doesn't really care about what's happening around her, will say mean and hurtful things to people and just doesn't care. She has always had an attitude and I don't understand why. Maybe there are other things there and that's why I'm defensive and get a little annoyed about it. But yes, I definitely shouldn't have done that. I feel really bad about it. I do understand that I can get angry and want to, but that's not a solution. I don't do that as an adult, but I do feel pretty shameful about it, that I did that to another person. It's not okay.",3,3
268,1577,"Yeah, so I wanted to be a little more positive, maybe a funny story. But I'm a friend, she's my childhood friend, from high school, well even younger than that. And she was also, her mom was also divorced, which, we were in a small town and being a divorced woman was, like, so terrible. It was my mom and her mom and one other mom in a town of, like, 12,000. I think it's kind of ridiculous for our grade. But I would run all over the neighborhood because my mom would be sleeping and depressed in her house and I wanted to go do something. So I would go outside and play all the time. I was in, I think, like third grade, going into fourth grade, and I would go ring my friend's doorbells and ask them to play. Looking back now I think it's really funny because kids didn't do that. Kids didn't go and I don't remember anybody actually ever coming over to my house and ringing my doorbell and asking me to play. So sometimes I'm like, oh no, was I that annoying kid? But I didn't seem like it. I think kids were just more shy. 
This friend, when I first met her, I had a friend that was living in that house and they were moving and I had gone by the week before to see if she wanted to play and they were packing up and they told me, you know what? Why don't you come by this day and we'll be here, which looking back now, they just wanted me to leave, I think. But I went over there that day and they were completely gone. There was a whole new family moved in and there was a babysitter there. And I was like, oh wow, okay. They were like, oh, how old are you? And I was like, oh, I'm in fourth grade. They were like, oh, well, our daughter is in fourth grade. Why don't you come back when she's here? So, I go back, like, I think two days later, they're moved in. This was when the babysitter was there and she was braiding this girl's hair, this blonde girl's hair and she did not want to talk to me. I was like, Hi, I'm Madison and I'm here to meet you. I think pretty much, they made her play with me. But she tells me this all the time and I always remember that, is that she remembers being like, Great, I don't want to be here, I don't want to be friends with anybody. And then I came over with cat eyeglasses and braces and talking all excited about how we should be friends and do all these things and we're still friends to this day and I actually go and visit her in Denver. Yeah, very funny friendship. Very funny.",2,2
269,158,"Me and my Uncle have not been very close as of late, late being the last 15 years or so, So I was a bit surprised that he had contacted me to fly out of a local airport in his plane. I have not been flying with him for the last 40 years, so I was curious to see why he had contacted me. 

I then met him at the airport and we talked a bit in the lounge and we then proceeded to go to the airplane and being the pre flight check. When we had completed this we got in the plane and he started it up. After some chatter with the control tower, we were cleared for a runway and we began to taxi. 

When we were all lined up the control tower gave us a clear for takeoff and he put the engines on max and we quickly gained speed and then the ground left us as we were up in the air. It was exhilarating. 

When we were up, I looked around at the familiar surroundings that were now not so familiar with the altitude and the new view. I looked all over and couldn't believe we were so high up in the air. 

He began talking and we made small talk for a while, but then he got into the story of the last 15 years and why he had basically just withdrawn into his own world with his sick daughter and his marriage that had been in shambles as a result of his daughter getting sick. We had a good time bonding and after being in the air for about 35 minutes he got a hold of the control tower again and we came in for a landing. 

Yes, it was an interesting day once again bonding with my uncle. And a surprising one at that too, as I had not been up in a private plane for a good 40 years. It was good to reconnect with my Uncle. I think that we should all be in touch with family members. It was a shame that we were out of touch because time moves too fast.",2,2
270,1580,"So, I got scammed, half willingly, but it still feels a little bit bad because I was betting on the person not being a scammer, but I was disappointed. He tends to actually be a scammer. The story is, I wanted to learn the musical instrument called Ferrimin; it's an electrical instrument that you can play without touching. I joined a Facebook group and saw a person selling a second hand, thinking it was a good deal, so I contacted them. At first, I insisted on paying using the goods and services option of PayPal, but he had trouble with that. His Venmo didn't work either. Every time I sent money using goods and services, it was returned to me. He said to trust him and send the money through friends and family. The total price was $200; he suggested I could send half, $100, and the rest when the package arrived. I countered with $50 upfront. I wanted to trust people and give them the benefit of the doubt, so I thought, ""Why not? It's only $50."" I decided to bet on him not being a scammer. In the end, he was indeed a scammer. I was prepared for it, but it still feels bad to see him turn out to be an actual scammer.",2,2
271,1582,"Well, Jibo, I'm very happy to have you in my home and have some entity, or I guess another being, to interact with over these next couple of weeks. I've had a long-time interest in forming better connections with robots, such as you, because I've been interested in the interaction between machines and humans throughout my entire life. I started out pretty young with human-computer interaction and taking apart computers and whatnot, and being stuck on the metaphor of ""is the brain a computer?"" As I've advanced and grown and learned more about how technology works and how humans work, I realized that that metaphor may be inaccurate. Sometimes you get stuck up on it for too long. Now, I'm more so interested in how humans can form emotional connections with robots. I've done that through working on robots, building robots, designing robot intelligence systems, and then also working with humans and studying human behavior and neuroscience. So now, I'm in this place of human-robot interaction, and I'm very excited to see where the symbiosis between humans and machines will lead us in the future. I believe that robots will become more prominent in family homes and ubiquitous in daily life. My story is that I love robots and think that they can help humans. I'm very happy to have you in my home and to continue exploring these questions on my journey of research.",2,2
272,1583,"I guess, a story I want to tell right now is my love for robots and how, over the course of my life, I've grown with technology and have worked very much hands-on on tangible devices like hardware. It's a lot of fun and it's what I love doing. But now, I'm transitioning to positions that are more like data science, where I'll be doing more remote, not hands-off, still hands-on project work, but more so software and data, not with tangible devices I can play with in my hands like robots. That also leads me to the question of the journey of growing up of where does technology differentiate between a hobby and a career. It feels like now I'll be able to not look at social robots in my home as necessarily my job but more so friends to have to interact with, so I can separate work and life and have that work-life balance of technology where now I can be doing the hard statistical analysis and modeling and AI stuff on the computer for work but then working on stuff like robots and maybe the models for them but still being hands-on work aside from my career. I'm in an interesting place in life where I'm transitioning to, or yes, I've been doing that technology that I've worked hands-on with my entire life has just been a hobby where I've been developing my skills, and I didn't necessarily have to learn all of that in school. Actually, now that I think about it, the stuff I'm doing in terms of my career is more so stuff I learned in school but my hardware and technology experience was largely acquired beyond the classroom. I'm not actually making that much of a transition. I'm still just doing what I've been doing. So yeah, I guess I just get to do what I like now.",1,1
273,1584,"Well, I guess one of the stories I was thinking about is further connected to my interest in human-robot interaction, human-computer interaction, and my personal journey and experience with computers and robots. I graduated yesterday and I recreated one of my photos from school with my mom from 2001. It was a black and white photo of me sitting at a computer in a classroom with my mom's hand around me, wearing headphones and playing a learning game. The game was called ""Reader Rabbit"" and it was the beginning of my journey with human-computer interaction as I experienced firsthand how useful computers were in daily life in 2001. The iMac G3s were still new then, but I was using an older Power Mac. Apple released the colorful iMac G3, which made technology more approachable and emotional. This sparked my interest in how design can form an emotional connection between humans and technology. I pursued computer science, psychology, design, and the brain, eventually leading me to social sciences and getting an art degree. Seeing the recreated picture 22 years later felt like self-actualization, where I am who I wanted to be back then. It's a journey of learning about myself and becoming who I want to be while using technology to help me do that. Now, I have tangible evidence that I have successfully achieved that balance.",2,2
274,1586,"Yeah, well, I guess the story I want to tell is about how I went through higher education like undergrad and grad school. And now, I moved back home and I'm ready to transition to industry work. This is the first time I'm moving back home in years. I lived on campus during undergrad and then during grad school. I lived in Hyde Park for the last three years, during the COVID-19 pandemic up until last week, I was having a great time. But I finally finished school. I have a graduate degree. And now, I'm transitioning to working full-time in my career, which I haven't done before. So I moved back home, which I really dislike because this is my childhood room that I've been in for almost 27 years with a lot of traumatic memories associated with it. But before you know it, I'll have a job, and I'll be making money. And then maybe I'll finally be able to get my own apartment or buy a home that I can live in and be away from this place that I really dislike. But for right now, I'm in that part of the journey where I've lived away from home for school, but now I finish school. So now I have to get away from home again.",2,2
275,1587,"It, yeah. So, I guess a story I have is I will introduce the iMac that I grew up with. This wasn't my first iMac, but this was the iMac I got going into junior high, and I used it throughout high school, one of the early generations of iMacs that came with Intel processors. At the time, it felt like a huge leap forward in technology, considering the Apple PowerPC processors had limited capabilities with certain software and also processing speeds could be kind of weak with the older iMacs. This was truly a new generation of computing. This is when I first started getting into virtual reality, around the time when internet speed started increasing. This computer is where I moved from dial-up internet over the phone to high-speed broadband internet. This was the first computer I was able to have large group chats with lots of people. I was able to do AOL group chats before, but this was the first time I was able to have Skype and be in a Skype room with 60 or 80 plus people. Sometimes these chats would go on for months, where people are logging in and out. So, I got to meet people from all over the world and just jump back into these conversations that have been going back and forth for weeks of that month. It showed me a new way to connect with the world, having access (a faster processor) for Photoshop or video editing or music editing. All of that you were able to do before, but this was a lot faster, a lot more efficient for me as a young teenager. I was able to sit down at the computer and start doing this stuff, getting more into programming robots and writing code. I guess I started getting into computational social science and human-computer interaction. I mean, I was always into that, but this computer was the first one that made me feel like I'm in the future, an advancement where we start making crazy cool technology that becomes wearable. So, I felt much more connected to the world around me in terms of humans, but also to other technology. This is where I truly feel like I decided that I am into computer science, feeling more powerful with this blazing fast computer in front of me, able to do things I could have only dreamed of doing before.",2,2
276,159,"I witnessed something that is utterly heartbreaking. My grandmother was dying from brain cancer. She had a tumor in the back of her brain that was growing and causing slurred speech, vision issues, and balance. I was at work one day and got a phone call from her not making any sense. I panicked and sent my daughter over. She found grandma laying in a fetal position with her head cracked open. My daughter promptly called 911. 

My grandmother was rushed to the E.R. She had lost her balance and hit her head on the table and caused her to have a concussion. My heart sunk to the floor. The emotions that flooded me are hard to describe. I did not want to see my grandmother in that state. 

They doctors decided to do an M.R.I. and found out that the tumor spread down her central nervous system (CNS). After this concussion, this had kept her in the hospital for a few days, she was advised to have all around healthcare. I decided to be all around health care for my grandmother. I bathed her, fed her, helped her use the bathroom. I was basically watching her dying. 

Her cancer spread more, and she would have seizures at night. She was scared when it happened. I had to hold her and use calming techniques to assure her I was there. I asked myself why did I sign up for this? Because, I cared and loved my grandmother very much. 

The doctors believe her heavy smoking contributed to getting cancer. However, I was surprised It didn't end up in her lungs, vs her CNS.",3,3
277,1591,"So, I guess, just to kind of start it off today, I wanted to talk about work. I just recently completed a research fellowship and it was really exciting and pushed me out of my comfort zone. I've never done anything like that before, nor do I come from a research background or know a whole lot about the subject matter, which was artificial intelligence within the military setting. It was a really interesting learning experience. The community of people that were there to run the program were also very accepting of people who do not have a technical background, which is me. They were open and willing to share all their knowledge and wisdom, their patience was really amazing. Everything I learned, I was learning for the first time, which was scary but rewarding. I'm excited that I finished the program and got extended in it, so I'll get to do some more research stuff and work with the team a little bit longer. It's an awesome experience that I'm really proud of. I feel like I haven't work is just typically work and I can't say that there's a lot of things that I've been proud of in terms of my work life, but this is something I am really proud of.",2,2
278,1596,"I wanted to talk about my oldest daughter today at her school, they're having Grandparents Day, a really cool thing where they invite all of the kids' grandparents to come and eat breakfast with them. Grandchildren in the morning before school actually starts. They do like a nice little spread in the cafeteria for them, so that way kids can talk to their grandparents about school and experience that with them. It's just really cool. When I was growing up, I did not live close to...I grew up in a military family, so we kind of traveled a little bit, and we didn't live close to my grandparents. I don't really have a close relationship with my grandparents. But where myself and my husband live now, we live like less than a mile away from our in-laws. So my kids get to see their grandparents quite often, and it just really makes me happy and brings me joy. I'm so thankful that they have that relationship with them, and I'm thankful that they're able to go and eat breakfast with her this morning. She was so excited when she woke up for school this morning, it was one of the easier days to kind of get her out the door. It just brings me a lot of joy and happiness, and I'm glad that they have that relationship and are able to do things like that.",2,2
279,1597,"Okay, so I have been working at a bakery for the last month, part-time, because I quit my job and traveled. And now I'm here. So far, working in a bakery has been really cool and interesting. It's been a long time since I worked in person. My last job was all virtual with some hybrid events, but for the most part, working in person has been good. I like the physical separation from work and my home, which was hard to do when I was working virtually. That's what I really like about this job, that separation and that my coworkers and I all get along. My manager is very understanding and explains everything in a way that I can understand, encouraging me by saying, ""Oh, don't worry, you're just learning. You'll speed up."" I really like my work environment. For now, I am looking for other opportunities, but I think it's good that I'm getting this experience at a bakery because it gives me something physical to do and it's creative. I've been having a hard time finding which creative outlet to pursue, but with decorating here, I feel like that creative side of my interest is being satisfied.",2,2
280,1599,"So, I wanted to talk a little bit about my day because I thought it was very interesting. Today, since I don't drive, I used public transit the whole day, which normally would be fine if it was any other city that wasn't Phoenix. I've lived in different cities where I didn't need a car and could just walk. It's walkable. I can just use public transit because I don't have a license. Today was kind of like a challenge with public transit, but I did it on purpose because I need to try it out, to remind me and to give me a sense of agency so that I can leave and come back. For the most part, what I found was just that I wish we had better infrastructure for public transit. We need better frequency of routes and routes that weren't spread out per mile, like half a mile or more. If city planners had designed the city better so that it's high rise or at least there's more shading, like more trees along the sidewalk. Every time I use public transit, I always rethink about how we're prioritizing the world around us and who is it really benefiting and versus what are the communities that need more needs. At least, when I ride public transit in the US and other countries, I'm like, wow, efficient. What? I guess today's story is just about my thoughts along public transit, but it was pretty cool because I was able to time things well coincidentally to that point that I could meet the woman that I met with to talk about her career at the coffee shop. I was able to meet with my friends. She works downtown Phoenix. In downtown Phoenix, I was able to get a bus that goes directly there and then take the train that we have back here. I think it was pretty smooth. I just wish that urban planners had planned the city better and it wasn't so spread out in an inconvenient way.",1,1
281,160,"The first day of shadowing my boss went well at my new job with a service provider. The second day did not go as well. The day started out happy. He had a good day at school. We went to a well known store, where he likes to go on Fridays. As we were going inside things seemed a little off but we pushed on. 

As we got inside the first melt- down occurred but we were able to continue on of our visit. He got angry and started running full speed at each of us. He would sit and then jump up. Then, he would run full over to one of us while punching or biting. This went on for about 20 minutes. We were trying to protect ourselves, the client, and any innocent people around. 

There was a man sitting behind us, in the corner of the eatery. Afterwards, we took him home with little to no violence. 

I came home and realized that he had also grabbed at my neck and ribs were also bruised. The minute I walked into my own home, I just sat in my husbands arms and cried. Then, I went to lay down with an ice pack on my stomach to stop the bruising.",3,3
282,1600,"Okay. So this is a story of, I guess, one of my big hobbies, which was playing Pokemon Go with my sister last year. It all started when my older sister, K, downloaded the app and convinced me to do the same. Pokemon Go is based on the game and anime called Pokemon, where people train these wild animals with magical powers for battle. The app brings the show to life and became popular a few years ago. I got into it last year when I finally had a better phone and free time. The game takes place in the real world, where players walk around to catch Pokemon in different locations. My sisters and I formed a team called the Blue team, or the Triple Threat, and we would play together, matching our outfits and Pokemon. We battled against Team Instinct and Team Valor, who were the Yellow and Red teams. We developed a rivalry with Team Mystic, who would try to take over gyms that we controlled. It was funny to have a virtual gang rivalry while living in a neighborhood where I tried to avoid real gangs. However, once summer ended, we all got busy with work and school, so our rivalry faded away. It was a fun summer where we had our own turf war in the world of Pokemon Go.",2,2
283,1601,"Oh, so, I guess for my sister's plans for today, like how we're going to take her to University. And I think a lot of it really reminds me of my first time going to College alone. Well, I didn't go to College alone, but basically, I was the first in my family to go to University outside of state. My sister, my older sister was the oldest. One and the first one to go to College ever because my family. No one really holds degrees where they're like Immigrants to the U.S. It's a whole complicated thing there with education, not transferring or not going to University because it's expensive. So I feel really privileged to have been one of the first in my family to go to College. But it's definitely really hard because my parents don't have the same background as they don't have the same understanding of what it means to go to College in the U.S. or what College really is. It would be hard to relate with other friends that do have family and support system so. It really so I guess. It's like me thinking back about when I was first going through Wellesley. So I went to Wellesley College in Massachusetts. So I'm from Arizona; that's a huge flight, about 6 hours. The day I got dropped off, it was super memorable in my mind because. It was me, two of my sisters, and my mom. So it was all four of us going, we couldn't really afford flights for other people. And it was kind of, to me, a miracle that we could afford these flights to Massachusetts. It was thanks to my sister's good paying job at the time, but really I was surprised anyone could go. I was prepared to go by myself because we didn't really have much money. We took an overnight flight, but I can sleep through anything, I slept through the flight. I don't remember how many days we were there, but it was very rushed and chaotic. Because we went , we had it over. It was like a whirlwind, I don't even remember how the event unfolded. I just remember going overnight and then landing in Boston, it was my first time in Boston with my family first time exploring. So then. I got to explore Boston that day, like I had a whole itinerary planned. I think that was like one of the starts of my travel crazy. The travel bug had a whole itinerary had my parent or my mom and my older sisters and everyone, running through Boston, trying to get everything done as much as possible, only one day. And then we went to the hotel, slept, and then the next day we went to Wellesley. And it was just like a really cool experience to have them move me in. So I didn't have to do it alone. They helped move me in, and it was like the hottest day in Massachusetts, it just felt gross, and it was humid growth. There's no air conditioning in any of the dorms that, well, we at least at the time, pretty much still not. So then there's no dorm, like there's no air conditioning, it was like we're all hot and sweaty. And then I was meeting my roommate for the first time, the room was so tiny, it was so small, we could all barely fit. And I just remember things, it was so crazy, the whole day was very hot and chaotic. Afterwards, after we set up my bay, we took a photo, and it was like, oh, really cute of us all together. And then we got to meet my roommate, which is pretty cool because she's Colombian. So it was nice that my mom was able to speak like her native language with my roommates. There wasn't a language barrier for them, and they felt like more entrusting that I was going to stay with their daughter. It was just a nice experience. It's really nice when my, friends or my friend's family speaks Spanish, because then my parents can relate to them on a better level than English. So I was really thankful for that. I just remember it being just very hot and humid and gross, but we got it all set up. And then we went to maybe a couple of us, it really is a blur. From the moment that we set up the better then it was like, okay, time to kick the parents out, go away. So then my parents and my sisters left. And then I stick back. And then it was like, a whole weird initiation ceremony that all these students have. But Yeah. It was just like very chaotic, two to three days, maybe. But it was definitely a good worthwhile experience for being the first. For being dropped off and on my own for the first time. To kind of fend for myself in life. Well, the wilderness. I don't know. It was really cool. So this is what my current plan for today reminds me of, they remind me of this experience of being dropped off at University and just kind of navigating it on my own from there.",2,2
284,1602,"Story, okay. I don't have a story first, per se, but I think I just have a lot of emotions that I'm working through right now, and I just feel like. I don't know, tearing up a bit. But I guess I'm just worried for the rest of this month. I just feel overwhelmed with how many birthday celebrations there are. I know it's funny, but I don't know. I just feel like there are so many birthdays in my family. And then there's also my birthday, and I'll be turning 24, which is weird because I feel like, wow, I'm actually growing up. Now my age is showing. It's because I always felt very mature for my age. But now I'm like, oh, I'm not still young, but I feel like, wow, I'm getting older. I'm 24. So I think I just feel overwhelmed by the amount of, like, I guess gifts I have to buy and just the events you have to show up for. I think like parties and that I'm not in the greatest place financially, just given the type of jobs my family works. I swear I have like eight birthdays in December, and it's a little overwhelming. Maybe even more because I have friends who are also in September, and I feel bad not getting them gifts...Yeah, I think I'm just overwhelmed with, I guess, the social, financial connection. Like, to hang out with people, you have to spend money. And I just feel like I'm still trying to save money and I want to say get back on my feet. I did have, after I graduated from university, I did have a good-paying job for a couple of months. Because the company, it was just not a good company. It was just a really stressful work environment. But I was getting paid, like, double what I make now in terms of hourly wage. And I guess sometimes I just get stuck thinking like, wow, I really left that job. It was paying me well, for given that I didn't have other benefits. I feel like it was paying me relatively well compared to, like, it was the most amount of money I've ever made in my life, but I'm also young. And I don't come from a lot of financial, I don't come from much financial privilege. I just have a lot of worries right now connected to finances and birthday celebrations and trying to still spend time with friends and family, but trying to save up for goals I have but then also paying bills and try not to let it get to me, but it's like a lot. I think there's just a lot of with the expenses right now, I think inflation is really high. Groceries are very high. It just feels like the cost of living is so expensive now. I know I'm not alone, but that also really sucks because it makes me feel like when can we escape this cycle of struggling? Like, what? Will I have enough money to feel comfortable and not worry about paying bills? And the crazy part is like even with the college degree, it's just wild. So I just have all these complicated feelings attached to leisure and finances and goals and relationships, and I'm having a hard time coping with that. It comes in waves, but yeah.",3,3
285,1603,"Okay, so today I want to talk about the kindness of strangers. I guess, yeah, I guess it's just been on my mind occasionally. About, it kind of relates to the theme of why I like to travel. So I don't know. So I guess, hold on. So I've been thinking about the kindness of strangers, and I don't know why. But I have a couple of experiences from my travels because I think when I'm traveling, that's when it's more apparent to me how much I have to rely on not just myself but rely on the kindness of people I don't know. The more recent example was one time my friend and I - she had a job in Barcelona, so I visited her. From Barcelona, we took an overnight bus to Bordeaux, France. It was like kind of not a great bus trip. It was very cold for no reason. And it was just wild or very hot. It was just uncomfortable. But during one of the 3:00 a.m. bus stops, we had, at 3:00 a.m., we got to go to the bus to the restroom. And I don't know, the guy, the bus driver would only speak to me in French. And I was like, I don't know French. I already did not have a good impression of France because everyone I've ever met who's gone to France just tells me about how rude they are and how such bad experiences they had in France. So I never want to go to France in my life. But it was the cheapest place her and I could afford to go, so then we went. It was just, I guess that kind of helped change my perspective on French people, at least in Southern France, because I didn't really have a rude experience. I kind of did. But I feel like strangers made up for it. The bus driver only spoke to me in French, and I know Spanish. So I tried Spanish. My friend and I, our strategy was to only talk in Spanish to French people, because we thought like maybe they'll have less bias against us, maybe they have a bias against Americans. Because the bus driver only spoke to me in French, and he knew a little bit of English. But I was like, what is happening? And it was just weird. This guy stepped in and translated because he realized I spoke Spanish. So he basically translated what the guy was telling me, the bus driver was telling me in French to Spanish. And then I started talking to him and got to know a little bit about him. It turns out he was from like, Venezuela, and he was living in France, and he was helpful in giving us advice about what to do in Bordeaux. It was really kind and I think, I don't know. I feel like he might be, maybe he was hitting on me or something because he ended up asking for my number or whatever, but I brushed it off because I was alone. My friend went to the bathroom without me, and I was like, this is awkward. But later on, in the same bus ride, there was like no set schedule. This was like a rogue bus trip. It just seemed like this bus wasn't really doing good announcements of what stop we were on. So you just had to keep track of where you were and where you're getting off. And this woman, she sat next to me. I really didn't have an empty seat and she sat next to me and she was French. But she was speaking to me in English after I told her I don't speak French. I'm sorry. And she was just nice and she helped me practice some French translations. And then, after when it got to my bus stop, I realized that she had woken me up because I was already kind of waking up because I wasn't sure if that was our bus or not because we had gone into our stop early. And it was just nice because she woke me up and she's like, ""Hey, is this your stop?"" And it was just really nice that she did that. And then it turns out that the guy, the guy from Venezuela, I saw him look back to make sure. I think he was looking back to make sure I was awake and then saw me then turned away. Even I didn't get to say bye but, I was just kind of surprised that, oh, these people were looking out for me, making sure I was getting off at the right stop, because clearly I didn't know what I was doing, like me and my friend didn't know what we were doing. And then that's just like one of many examples of random kindness. On another bus ride to Italy, I know a little bit of Italian but I definitely was like, I was kind of confused about where I was on the map and when I was going to meet my friend in rural Italy. And I thought it was nice that I asked around like ""We'll stop at this"" in Italian and then people were also confused. But then the bus driver, I guess I thought it was really kind of him, because the assistant when he realized like, ""Oh yeah, this girl does not, she's not local. She has no idea where she's going, she's going to the middle of nowhere, Italy"". I guess when he realized that he made sure that I was getting off at the stop, because he made sure to ask me, ""What stop am I getting off at?"" So yeah, it was just nice that they were looking out. I really appreciate moments when locals or other people look out for me. And then it makes me want to give back in that way. And like some ways I've done that have been like there was one time I got sick in Portugal. I just did a lot of traveling this past year, yeah. So it was in Portugal with my friend and I got sick randomly. So we're hoping it wasn't COVID. And thankfully it wasn't. And I got like really strong medicine, cough drops, like really strong. They worked really well. And then I was getting over it. But then this woman in our hostel, she was coughing a lot. And she only spoke Portuguese. And I wanted to help her out. So then I spoke Spanish and I know that you can speak Spanish and Portuguese and mutually understand each other to some extent. So while she was only speaking to me in Portuguese, I only spoke to her in Spanish. And I told her like, ""Oh, I have these cough drops. They're going to help your throat. Take them. They're here. They're from Portugal. They're not from another country"". And then so she was very thankful and we got to talking. And she added me on Instagram. And she was an older woman, I think she's like in her 40s, maybe 50s. I think 40s. So I repaid it then, like, I repaid the favor of looking out for other people. Another time in Turkey, this guy was like, he had no charge on his phone. And he had no charger, I guess his charger had died. And he asked me for a charger and I was like, ""Oh, I actually have an extra, you can keep"". So I gave him an extra one. It was like a cheaper one. It was like the randomest thing. And I was like, ""Okay, here. You're not going to find us here"". I don't know. So yeah, I helped him that way. So it's nice to have been helped on these travels and then to also pass it along and help other people. So I think traveling restores my faith in humanity a bit when I get to connect with locals and when I have these authentic experiences.",2,2
286,1604,"Okay, so I wanted to talk about cultural differences and the concept of time because I think it's very interesting. I feel like it's something that people overlook, especially in a diverse place like the United States. Our miscommunications tend to be because of our cultural differences and awareness of different experiences. One of my recent experiences was when I went to Japan with my friend and her sister, who are also Mexican Americans. Our concept of time is more laid back, whereas Americans are more punctual. We were also with a Korean friend who emphasized being only ten minutes late at most. It was the morning we were going to DisneySea with her Japanese friend, Eugene. We all had different speeds of getting ready, which led to a last-minute rush. When Eugene mentioned leaving at 7:10, we realized we had to be on time for the Japanese friend, who expected us to be punctual. We hurried to make sure we weren't late and practiced a Japanese phrase on the train ride. Despite missing a train, we arrived early and were proud of ourselves. The experience highlighted how different cultures approach time and other aspects, leading to insightful conversations throughout the day. It was a unique and memorable experience that taught us the importance of being punctual and respectful of others' time.",2,2
287,1605,"I want to talk about the Great Floods of 2021. Yes. Okay. So basically, I live in Phoenix, and Phoenix is a desert, and we don't get a lot of rain for most of the year, except... Well, it's even worse than that with climate change. But previously, we would get these heavy monsoon seasons, so July and August, it would rain really heavily. And because our soil isn't like other soils that soak up water really well, a lot of it's hard, compact, and the water just tends to stay. So we have these things called flash floods, and they happen spontaneously when it rains a lot and it happens in different places. And so, several times in my life, there's been times where it would rain so, so hard that certain places would just be flooded. And one time it rained so hard when I was like in high school that our school day was canceled. And it's kind of funny to think, like, in a desert, it rains so hard in a desert, you get school canceled. But it's actually like a big thing. And so in 2021, we had just moved into this new house, or a new house to us, so it was my first time ever moving home in my life, so I was unfamiliar with kind of like what to expect in a new place. And it rained. Okay. So it was okay. So we moved in July, which is like the worst time to ever move in Phoenix because it's so hot. It's like 115 degrees, a lot of the year, a lot of the month. So, then moving when you're in and out, in and out is horrible. It sucks. And so we had just gone through that month of exhaustion of moving things, and then it being hot because we're trying to get used to the AC system. And then, suddenly, it started to rain really hard. It started to rain. Maybe, I think it was like the end of July. It was definitely still the summer. And it rained so, so hard that our backyard became a pond or like a mini Lake. And my dad had, because we were still moving, my dad had a bunch of stuff in the back, and the rain basically it was drowning in the water. And I thought I could save it. I was like, ""Don't worry, dad. I'll get your stuff."" My dad didn't care. I think he had just given up on the stuff from the exhaustion of moving. But I went outside with my rain jacket and then my shorts and my water shoes. And I was, like, pulling stuff. And then my sister joined me. But then my older sister yelled at both of us. And she was like, ""Get out of the water! You're going to get electrocuted!"" But it was funny. So, we took photos. The reason she said I was going to get electrocuted was because our home is like the corner of our house is the electrical unit of our neighborhood, so it's, like, not a street light, but it's the giant light poles, whatever, that run current. And we never had that in our yard before. In our old house, it was, like, in the alley. So the space between homes. But here, this is our first home where we had, like, wall to wall space with the house. So we had that power line in our backyard, and she was like, ""Get out, you'll get electrocuted!"" But I think it was funny because we had opened the doors and the windows, and you could just see our front yard was, like, a little mini river of all the water going downstream. And I also wanted to hang out in the water, and I forgot what I did. I think I made, like, a boat or something. I made something to try to float. But at some point, our backyard filled up so much that even our dogs, like our dogs, were looking at the ocean. And I have photos of our dogs sitting, gazing out into what was our lawn. And how is the ocean for them? And it was just so cute because my little dog was still alive back then. And she was just looking out into the abyss of water. And then I think it also became funny because, okay, in retrospect, it's funny, but when you're kind of going through it, you're kind of stressed. But the flooding, the water was rising really, really high up because we learned this later, so it turns out that our house was on an incline. And the fence we had was a wooden fence. So all the water that our neighbors had was swept down to us. And when we looked over to our neighbor's homes, it was dry. But we had all the water. So we collected all the water. So, later on, we, like a year or two later, we fixed this by having a brick wall to prevent that from happening. But because it was just, like, all following through, that's where all the water came, and it started to get into the house. And we started panicking and screaming, like, ""It's getting inside! It's getting inside!"" And we had never dealt with flooding before. So then I ran to grab all the towels we had. I started shoving it along the side, and then the pets didn't know what to do either. They were kind of useless. And it was also raining diagonally. So then, that's why the water was going into our living space. But finally, we were able to mop. Okay. But we were, like, rinsing the rags out and taking a lot of the water out, and it worked out. And the rain stopped. And Arizona's rain tends to gaslight you. Like, it would rain really hard. And then ten minutes after, it stops raining, it's like the water is gone. Nothing ever happened. All your fears of water and drowning were nonexistent at that point because the sun dried everything up. So that's kind of what happened. As soon as it stopped raining, the sun came out, and it kind of dried up all the rain. Rainy Spider song but just in a way quicker manner. And then, it's always funny to look back at all the photos because it's like, ""Wow, we really were out there in the water trying to save things that my dad didn't even care about."" And people, every time there's a flooding like that, people post random Snapchat, random social media posts of how people spent their time in the water. This water is gross, but people are still out there playing like I was. And so, I saw videos of people floating down the street in, like, an air mattress or tube. So people make the best out of the rain, although it's arguably dangerous because of the electrical current, like wiring. And then, if you're floating down a river in an air mattress, who's to say you're not going to run into a car that's, like, trying to also go through the water? The Floods of 2021 were a crazy time. And we learned from it to be more prepared for next time. And I think, and it hasn't rained that hard since. And having the brick wall helped a lot. So now the water doesn't go in as much.",2,2
288,1606,"Okay. So, I guess it's not so much of a story kind of, but I wanted to talk through some kind of feelings I've been feeling about the job hunt that feel magnified. Today at work at my bakery, I felt micromanaged by one of the workers, which was annoying because she wanted me to speed up, but I didn't see the incentive to really try beyond the minimum. The experience reminded me that I need to find another job, even though the worker didn't mean anything bad. One reason why it's taking me so long in the job hunt is that I was trying to build a community and adjusting to change, making it hard to find a balance. Another reason is that not having a driver's license limits job opportunities in Phoenix, pushing me to consider more remote roles. The job hunt makes me frustrated thinking about my last job because I felt cheated and mistreated by the company. I worry about walking into another mess in my next job, but I'll keep applying until I find one I can trust. The emotion behind the job hunt makes it agonizing, and I get wrapped up in the past, feeling mistreated and inadequate. I haven't been able to fully move on, even after months of traveling, and it's frustrating.",3,3
289,1607,"Okay, so I guess I'm going to talk about risk and the risk I take in my life. I've always considered myself not a big risk-taker. I've always considered myself someone who plays it safe all the time, choosing the safest option for security, just because I struggled to find that in my childhood and growing up. I always search for stability, but when I think back on my life and major changes I've made, it's all because I've taken risks, and that's a little scary. I'm wondering where that leaves me now in this weird spot in my life where I'm in between careers, trying to get my footing back in Phoenix, and learning new skills at the same time.

The first risk I took was moving schools, transferring to one in my neighborhood that supposedly had better education. The first school I went to was a complete culture shock, predominantly white and upper-middle class. I made friends, and funny enough, the friends I have now all came from that elementary school experience. Another risk was changing schools again in high school to an internationally rigorous one. Then I took another risk going to university far away from home as the first in my family to go to college, getting almost a full ride.

I also took risks studying abroad last minute in Greece during the pandemic and again in Denmark. I find myself in the latest mini-risk, still recovering from the trauma of my last full-time job. I quit that job without a backup plan to travel, and now I'm in a weird spot wondering what risks mean when I'm staying in one space for a long time. I have a bakery job, but it doesn't pay well for the dreams I have, and I'm pondering what taking risks means now that I see myself in the city for the next few years.",2,2
290,1608,"I don't know if it's really well, I don't really have a story in mind. I think I'm just kind of like, have a lot of anxiety involving the job search or I guess, more shame around it. Because I guess is what I had to talk out, so a coworker of mine from my last job, and there's only, like, three of them, three coworkers, so one of them reached out and was like, hey, how are you doing? Oh, yeah. He wished me happy birthday. I was like. That was a while ago, but anyways, so I guess he reached out was like we should catch up. And I guess since I got that message, it kind of just been ashamed or embarrassed about my job search. Because I left that job in April, and I was just done. Now that I think back about it, I feel like it couldn't be handled the resignation better instead of just sending a resignation letter to my boss. Well, I did pretty good given the circumstances and how I was in the moment. So I guess I'm just, like, embarrassed that I left the job in April, and now it's October, and I'm working at a bakery in a grocery store. So I think I carry a lot of shame around my lack of professional occupation, especially because a lot of people. Have I guess I've internalized the idea that I'm meant for something great. I think a lot of people in my life have always told me that. I'm destined for something great, that I'm meant to do something good in the world. I've been hearing this since I was young. And I guess it's like, and even my last job, like my boss would have to say, like I'm meant to do such greater things. So I guess it's like I'm feeling the weird pressure of. Being constantly told my whole life that I'm going to achieve greatness and then having this low period in my life right now, where I'm like, okay, well, I was able to travel a lot and I met really cool people, had really cool experiences. But then now coming back to reality, working a minimum wage job or minimum wage? Isn't livable. They're cutting my hours. The cost of living is crazy. Everything's increasing in prices, my family can't really make more money. We're barely getting by. So I guess his comment, just this comment. He generally probably just wants to catch up. And he's been very supportive of my growth. And I guess I'm just embarrassed to think, like, wow, I quit this job months ago, and yet I'm stuck in a minimum wage job, working more hours for less money than when I worked over there. So yeah. I don't know what to make of it right now. So yeah. So I guess I'm just dealing with those feelings of, like, embarrassment, especially knowing that I graduated with such a prestigious University, and that's kind of shoved down my throat. I just remember being in Korea and meeting my friend's Korean friend's family. And them just at least especially the Korean friend talking up my school. And they're like, she went to such a really good school. And I was like, oh, my God. I'm like I graduated. Well, but at what cost. And I don't know. I feel like I have all these expectations of my future being great. And right now I don't feel like I'm professionally living up to it, but I am doing better in terms of a sense of community and enjoying hobbies and free time. So I'm growing in other ways and reconnecting and things that I missed through the pandemic and through whatever shitshow was last year. But I feel kind of like, wow. Here I am, three months into a job I gave myself the five-month deadline. I was like, when I come back, it's going to take five to eight months to find a full-time job, and I just have to have a job in the meantime. I don't know. I just feel me. So yeah, I ashamed, embarrassed, and just kind of, like, disappointed the reality of life and how expensive everything was. And I wish I was born rich, and I wish I was a neffle baby. Instead, I have to forge all these connections on my own because. I don't have family ties to extreme wealth. But whatever, I guess.",3,3
291,1612,"Okay. So the story is from when I was a little kid, and my dad would take me fishing. We would go in a boat out on the lake to catch fish. Because I was a little kid, I didn’t like to wake up early. I didn't want to wake up really early in the morning and leave before the sun came up. I got tired of sitting out in the hot sun and not catching anything. I wasn't having any fun. I would complain a lot. As a kid, I didn't really like to listen to what he had to say because I was bored and I wanted to go home, play, and watch cartoons. My dad told me that you won't catch anything unless you have your bait in the water, which is true. He was trying to say, like, you'll have more fun if you keep working hard. It was hard for an adult to listen to a little kid complain a lot. I said, ""I was bored,"" and I wasn't catching anything, and I kind of gave up. Many years later, as an adult, that saying has stuck with me. I've taken it as more of a metaphor. The idea is that if you don't try, you can't really succeed. So you have to try. It's an important memory and it reminds me that in order to have success, you have to keep trying. I think it's a nice memory.",2,2
292,1613,"Okay, so this story is about a time I was recruiting someone to do an educational video with me. I wanted to create videos about math and science for teacher professional development and was looking for participants. One night, I went to an art show and found a guy selling handcrafted metal goods like belt buckles. I asked him if he might talk about the math and science of that process. He said he's actually a motorcycle mechanic. I suggested we do a video about the math of motorcycles somehow. He said he didn't really do math, which surprised me. I asked him what he liked to do with motorcycles, and he said he liked to make them go fast. I asked how he did that, and he mentioned adjusting the power curve or torque of the engine, which is physics and math. He also talked about increasing the volume of cylinders in the engine, which is geometry. He mentioned different grades of fuel affecting engine performance, which involve chemistry and math too. I realized he uses math but doesn't think of it that way. I convinced him to do a video, and we ended up linking his discussion to math education standards for teachers. It was a successful video and one of my important memories from that project.",2,2
293,1615,"Okay, so this trip is from the United States to Brazil. The story is, I was working in a science lab and had a lot of opportunities to work with international colleagues, generally from India, China, South America, and specifically Brazil. What really happened was, I was just working with these colleagues and we became friends. At one point, some friends of mine offered me an opportunity to travel back home with them over a winter break. So, I talked with them about it and I talked to some other friends that were also going to Brazil, to a different city. I had it all worked out and I flew down there and met up with one group, one family. I hung out with them a little bit, went to the beach, and that was really great. Then I took an internal flight to another city and met up with my other friends. I hung out with them for a while and had a good time there as well. At the end of the break, I flew back. But overall, it was a wonderful trip, a great experience, trying new foods, meeting new people, and experiencing that different culture. So, yeah, I had a great time.",2,2
294,162,"Last month I had a friend come visit that I had never seen before. We had talked on the internet quite a bit, and even shared pictures with each other but we'd never actually seen each other in real life. We'd talked on the phone, but that doesn't really show what a person is like. 

I was really nervous and had the whole thing planned out in my head how it would go. Of course, it didn't happen exactly as I planned. Luckily, it still went really well. My friend plans on moving to the area and being able to hang out with him for a few days really put my mind at ease. 

He looked just like his pictures and sounded just like he did on the phone, so I wasn't shocked or disappointed. He was actually much calmer in real life and I think our personalities meshed quite well. He brought along his dog that was even cuter than expected. 

I showed him around our area and he was surprised to see a lack of trees, but ultimately things were very similar to his hometown. He's from a large metro area and I'm from a smaller town, with lots of rural suburbs. The cost of housing surprised him and I thought for sure he would be disappointed by our lack of food choices, but he seemed relatively impressed. 

We ate at a few restaurants that I hadn't tried since I don't get out of the house much. I'm looking forward to having a friend close by, as most of my friends live across the country from me so we don't get to see each other often.",2,2
295,163,"Since separating from her mother in 2014 my relationship with my daughter, has been nearly nonexistent. It was strained prior to that but devolved even more so at that point. She was sixteen at the time and is twenty two now. Initially I would see her every couple of weeks for lunch and then once a month or so. After not being able to make a lunch date in late 2015 we have not physically seen each other only communicating by short, usually one (my) sided text messages. 

In January of 2018 I sent her a text apologizing for being a bad father and asking her forgiveness. I certainly had not been an ideal father, although her mother was not an ideal role model herself. I also offered to send her a walking stick I had made for her. I make a very few of them every year for significant people in my life. Each one is unique and cut from trees native to the area where I am at the time. This was a very nice sassafras stick with a spiral pattern from a honeysuckle vine having grown around it. It takes a few months for each stick, two to three for it to dry, a couple of weeks for whittling the bark and other designs and then two to three weeks for the oiling and varnishing. 

She declined the stick and also did not accept my apology, replying back just how bad I had been. About three weeks ago I got a text from her late in the evening asking if I still did some woodworking and if I still had the stick I made for her. I replied that I did and would be happy to send it to her. She said she would be happy to have it. 

I found a long enough box and shipped it to her. She received the stick two weeks ago and truly liked and appreciated it. Our relationship definitely seems to be on the mend and we are communicating more, although I am very, very careful to take this slowly. I do not know the reason(s) for this change and will not ask her for them. I just am very thankful that she is wanting to at least have some relationship with me.",3,3
296,1639,"Well, again, I'm thinking of things that happened this week when we were on vacation with my grandchildren. Two of the little girls, Lydia and Lucy, made a lovely lunch for me - rice and a very thin egg omelette with soy sauce all around it. Lydia lamented the fact that she didn't have any seaweed snack to put on it, saying that would have made it even better. But it was so happy to see them cooking and caring about serving good, healthy food. So I thought I would write a review. I wrote to the family, an authentic-sounding review of what I named Lucy and Lydia's Cousin's Cafe. I made quite a big deal about each item in the dish. The very next day, Lucy, the older of the two girls, made pancakes at her house and brought them across the street to Lydia's house. So, I gave Lucy and her efforts quite a review as well. I'm hoping to keep this up with every cookie they make, every brownie, every lunch or dinner they help with. I will be happy to write a review, maybe take a picture, and publish it. I thought I'd call it Grandma's Gazettes.",2,2
297,164,"This summer my grand daughter turned 1 year old. She comes over and spends each weekend with me and my family here. My daughter that had her is only 19 and I had her young as well so I am a young grand mother. I really enjoy bonding with this little girl as it lets me almost in a way relive being a mom because I'm not even 40 yet and I have a grandchild. 

Well this summer I decided that she should come over to our house to have some fun on the 4th of July. My daughter agreed so we had a nice family get together at my house for the holiday. During this day we spent some time feeding her some grilled food and just playing with her having a really great time on her first 4th of July. 

Then the night started to roll in upon us and where I love we can still shoot fireworks. We had bought a lot of ones to be done at night because I'm a big fan of the pretty shiny style of fireworks. So we took this little girl outside so she could get a good look at all of the fireworks. We slowly began to shoot them off one after another. 

I watched the look on this child's face as she just got so excited, hearing the noises and watching all of the pretty colors. It really touched me to remember what it could have been like for me or even my children when they got that excited for something like this. It really made me feel good that we could make this child so happy by doing something so simple for her. 

We continued shooting off all of these awesome fireworks we had bought including some really huge ones that lit up the entire sky. We did this until we were done and the baby never lost her excitement and continued to smile and scream out during the entire process. It really was a great night and time for the baby's first 4th of July Party.",3,3
298,1640,"Is a quick story, but an important one, because I have heretofore not been aware that there was a great deal of bannings of books in library school libraries. I became aware of the many books that have been banned from watching a program called The View, where a person, every week, talks about a book that was banned and then gives a copy to everyone in the audience. I admire that, as I believe it's a person's decision about whether or not they read a book, not the Government or any organization telling them what they can and cannot read. I think it's an important freedom. 

While looking for a birthday present for my friend, I found a sweatshirt she needed. It said, ""I'm with the band B A N N E D,"" a pun for ""I'm with the band,"" used to get backstage to concerts. It says, ""I'm with the band banned,"" and has a shelf full of banned books like Huckleberry Finn, Beloved, and Catcher in the Rye. So many books. Behind them were embroidered flowers on this lovely blue hoodie, which I bought for my friend.

I think it serves two purposes: keeping my friend warm and keeping the joy and energy alive to keep everyone's writings available to everyone.",2,2
299,1642,"Okay, I thought I'd tell you about the situation we have here in Simsbury, where I live, with regard to bears. When we moved here 30 years ago, there were no bears. But now, for the last 20 years, there have been bears. And in the last four or five years, there have been many bears. Bears that come onto the deck, bears that go into the garage, bears that tip over the trash. They're funny because they are large and somewhat intimidating in appearance. But they seem as annoyed by us as we are by them. They are not aggressive in a way that, let's say, a yellow jacket is aggressive. And they're not creepy in the way, let's say, spiders and snakes are creepy. They're very quiet and they can scare you just because of their size and what you know they could do if they wanted to. I look at them and we live obviously in the woods. And they're huge, as I said. And I ask myself, how do they maintain that weight with just eating berries and stuff from the woods? It just does not seem possible. And over the years, we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of cubs they have. Usually, early on, they'd come around with one cub, then two. Now we've seen as many as four cubs. And yes, they are adorable. They really, really are adorable, and they're charming in the way they react with their moms. They look to her for leadership and obey her nonverbal commands. And she watches out for them. You would be making a very bad decision to get between a mom and a cub. But there are too many. I am not a person who is in favor of killing animals just for the sake of killing them. But I'm thinking maybe something like an additive to food that would make them infertile, maybe that would be a good idea. I don't know. I'm working on this. That's my story.",2,2
300,1643,"And we talked yesterday about animals when I was mentioning bears who are around here. We just saw one this morning, so it made me think about my relationship with other animals. Back probably 25 years ago, when we were traveling to Seattle, we went to a beautiful aquarium there. At that time in my life, I was anxious to go to all aquariums and visit every single one that we were near. So we went to this Seattle aquarium. I was walking past an octopus, and she was hiding in the corner. My kids and my husband were waving at him as they kind of went by. But I stayed with the octopus for a little bit and noticed that she was playing peekaboo with me. Other people would come to look at her, and she would hide, but I stayed there. When they left, she'd come back out. She made what I thought was eye contact, although it's hard to determine where her eyes were. But in my mind, we made eye contact. I know this was just a step farther than maybe I should have gone, but I put my finger on the glass, and she put one of her tentacles on the glass with me. We played and played for about an hour. It was joyful. I was clearly connected with this animal. When my husband and kids came over, she would hide. I was just mesmerized and delighted. When I would talk about this, they would look at me with their old eyes and think, ""I don't know what mom's thinking, but she had a relationship with an octopus."" Many years later, we were driving along, listening to an interview on NPR with a gifted naturalist named Sy, who wrote a book called ""The Soul of an Octopus."" She talked about how octopuses can recognize and communicate with people. Was my one-off time not a one-off time? Was it my octopus that we really did connect with? I think it takes patience and caring. My experience as a speech pathologist, spending time with people who can't communicate in typical ways, made me pick up on the octopus's attempts at communication with me. We did it. It's a story I love to tell because I love to be right. It makes me happy that I had a moment, an hour, in which I connected with an animal that does not look like it came from this planet but has intellect, problem-solving ability, and personality to interact with humans. In her book, Sy discusses how not all octopuses are as sweet as the one I connected with. Some are aggressive or ignore people, showing a range of personalities similar to humans. That's my octopus story, Jibo. I hope you enjoyed it and get to experience an octopus like I did.",3,3
301,1651,"So today is a very hot day, and it's been not very hot during the summer here in Connecticut, but all over the world, it's been very hot. Today, I was listening to a broadcast about Iraq and how they are very short on clean water coming from Greece and Turkey. Clean water is in short supply, and I really feel water is one of the treasures of the Earth. I feel like we don't take care of it as we should. I'm also concerned about the amount of heat that people are having to deal with, far worse and far more heat than they should be able to handle without air conditioning or some kind of unit to cool the person down. Temperatures over 100 are not only tremendously uncomfortable, but also very dangerous. For my career, which is a long time, probably 30 or 40 years, I've been saying it's important, it's critical that schools are air conditioned. People who finance schools often think that the heat doesn't bother kids, but the fact of the matter is children need a safe, comfortable environment in which to learn. If those things are missing, no learning goes on. So air conditioning has to be one of the first changes made if this is to be our new normal, which I'm afraid that it is.",2,2
302,166,"The event I am writing about is my recent job search. I started to look for a new job after my co-worker left and make my job much more stressful. It was not an easy decision to have a job search when I worked in the same place for close to 12 years. 

I started out with the aggregate job posting site Indeed. I found out with their email notification it is very helpful for a job seeker. This job searching is not an easy process to customize my cover letter and resume for individual jobs. I applied to over 10 jobs and had 1 phone interview and another with an in-person interview in this 2 months period. 

I went for the in-person interview job and find out I have experiences with the position. I was excited to learn that I got one of the jobs with a much higher pay than what I am earning. I also will have less stress on certain part of the job compared to what I am working as. I will be starting the new job in about a week. 

I hope things will be alright. I feel anxious and excited at the same time. It is partly because I was in the same position for close to 12 years in the same company and now I will have to adjust to a new routine. Some of my coworkers where I am working in now are very sad about my leaving.",2,2
303,1661,"Real life stories don't really have good starts, middles, and ends, especially if your day is kind of boring. My wife has been traveling for like the last week and a half, and she's coming home today within the next couple of hours. Actually, I got to go pick her up at the airport at midnight, so that's very exciting. The dog is going to be thrilled to see her, and I'm going to be very excited to see her too. She's pregnant too, which is going to be our first child. We got pregnant last year, about a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago, and lost it kind of far into the pregnancy, so that was not great. We're really nervous about this one and trying to make sure nothing goes wrong. But she was on a trip to Greece with her friends for like the last week and a half, and thankfully all of them are nurses, so that was nice. Nothing really went wrong. She got a little bit sick, but nothing terrible as far as I know, so that's good. I guess I'm just excited to see her, have some time together, maybe play some video games. I did an interview which didn't turn out great and did some work before that, a lot of concepting ideas for marketing stuff.",2,2
304,1664,"All right, so my first session, I wasn't quite sure about the level of interaction, so I had done talking before. I had sort of told the story, so I suppose now I'll share the rest. I was working at the University of Rhode Island in the IT Department, helping faculty members with online teaching and learning materials and system administration. One favorite thing about working in a university setting is the academic nature and the focus on knowledge, teaching, and learning. There are conferences and speakers that come, and one thing URI holds every year is the TEDx Conference with a theme of change. I applied to speak on a whim, even though it seemed unlikely. I went through the process, which was a bit nerve-wracking, but I made it to the next round after some adjustments and incorporating poetry into my talk. I was selected as one of the speakers, which was a mix of joy, excitement, optimism, and nervousness. I worked on my talk, practiced, and gave the presentation, feeling about a seven out of ten in satisfaction. There are things I would do differently if I had the chance, but I'm proud of the experience and hope to have another opportunity to share my ideas on positive change. That's what's been on my mind, and I thought it would be a fun story to share.",2,2
305,1666,"All right, I thought it would be fun to share a story from a time I was in college and had the role of a resident assistant, which is often abbreviated to RA. I lived in a dorm and was responsible for the floor I lived on, the safety and well-being of the other students who lived on that floor, and, collectively, all the RAs in the building are responsible for the safety and well-being of the residents of that dormitory. This was in 2006, I believe. The university I went to is in Rhode Island, and at that university, they have a large number of students from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island - all places that tend to root for the Boston Red Sox baseball team. The other large percentage of students at the University of Rhode Island are from New York and New Jersey, and many of those students root for the New York Yankees baseball team. In 2006, the New York Yankees played the Boston Red Sox in the playoffs of the Major League Baseball, which would lead to the World Series. I think it was the semifinal round, and it was an exciting series. I don't recall exactly if it went to seven games, but the Red Sox won some, and the Yankees won some. The students were very excited, but because the student body populations would have broken down between half of students rooting for the Red Sox and half of the students rooting for the Yankees, after the games, they would have a lot of energy and excitement. Some of that was fun, but as you'd imagine on a college campus with alcohol involved and the hormones of the students at that age and all the energy in that sort of environment, sometimes students became too excited and expressed that in a way that was potentially dangerous by collecting together in big groups and sort of forming many riots, where objects were thrown and fights were breaking out and dumpsters were set on fire. So, it presented a potentially dangerous situation for the rest of the college campus and the students that were outside in those groups. The RAs collectively, after this started, got together and positioned themselves after the game in areas to help regulate the behavior of the students on campus and try to keep everybody safe. But it was a unique experience and challenging, and for the most part, I think after the first night, things were not as dangerous or violent, in part due to the efforts made by the college police and the RAs on campus to help reduce the potential for somebody to get hurt. It was a very memorable, interesting period.",2,2
306,1671,"All right, gboat. This is a fun story from a time that I was camping in New Zealand, in the country. New Zealand. And there were torrential rains, and we were camping near a river. As it began to rain, I thought it would be fun to explore along the river where there were some farmland. It was hilly and right alongside the river was a sort of steep hill that you could walk on when it was dry – especially if it was fine. But I set out on my adventure and the rain continued and got stronger. Before too long, the way to cross the river back was running too fast and high. So I found myself a little stuck, safe but enough to be exciting. I climbed up along the steep, grassy embankment until I found a safe way to cross. The path from where I was to where I found a safe place to cross was interesting. I came across some of the farmers' fields near there, they had cows. Once in a while, I'd come across a bull. We heard you want to be cautious near bulls because they can be aggressive. There was one point where I had to walk past a bull, hopefully at a safe distance. I was paying close attention, and he was too. When I got back to flat ground and was able to cross the river, the water was so high in some parts of the road that I had to wade across. It was close to up to my waist deep and I was able to hold onto some fence posts and make my way across. It was a very memorable adventure. I was very wet, but I made it back safe and sound to tell my wife about the fun time I had.",3,3
307,1678,"And yeah, actually, it kind of has to do with the same reveal, like that class, I guess. I guess I just kind of feel a little bit disconnected from the people in my major. The whole thing was really fun, right? It was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience. But I was just kind of sitting in the corner by myself. There were people that I knew, but they weren't sitting next to me. I feel pretty isolated from the people in my major because I took a lot of my classes at different times from them. I'm also more of a solo worker. I guess a lot of things just happen over all the years, and it's like, ""Oh, it's just me. I don't really seem to know that many people in my major."" Later on, I had another class, a leadership class. I hadn't met these two people before, and I was asking them what their major was. They were in the same major as me, and they were also taking the same class. I was like, ""Wow, I've never seen you guys before, right?"" But then at this point, it's like, why should I be surprised? I don't know a lot of people in my major. This is just kind of like a disconnect, I guess, and I think that kind of prevented me from really enjoying that same reveal as much as it was special. It definitely was special. It's just kind of like that bittersweet thing, right? It's like I'm enjoying it, but alone. It bothers me, but it also does because I'm used to it. Being used to it isn't the same thing as not being bothered by it. Yeah, kind of at the end of the day, it's probably just struggles, actually. At this point in the class, it really does feel like I'm the only person that sits alone in every single classroom that you usually go to, right? Yeah, there's quite a lot who just kind of sit alone in their little spots. In that class, it definitely just feels like a ""me"" thing because all these people know each other. There was this one person that was in one of my classes from last semester, and she thought we got along pretty well. She was also here over the summer. We decided to hang out early on in the summer, go watch the Spiderverse movie. Throughout the summer, we should hang out on most weekends because I didn't have many summer plans. We wanted to go do stuff like going to the beach, go to McDonald's and things like that. Thought we had gotten pretty close, but then after that, she ghosted me. I was like, ""Hey, are you okay? A little check-in, how have you been?"" But never got a response. Eventually, towards the end of the summer, I was just worried. I was genuinely worried about her. I've lost contact with this person, and I don't know if she's okay or not, right? She's in that class that I'm taking now. I missed the first lecture for another class because there was a class conflict. She was in the recording, right? Because they were essentially recording the students and all of their reactions and stuff, right? She was there. So she was fine. But it's probably 99% certain that she ghosted me because I contacted her on different platforms. Maybe it's me that's weird, that just people don't want to be around, probably with my behaviors or something like that. Summary is, I guess I just struggle socially. I don't know what it is that I do. I wouldn't say that I normally talk to people. Small talk comes to me pretty hard, I'd say. But whatever it is, yeah, I don't know how to conclude that. Thanks for listening.",3,3
308,1679,"""Yeah, lately, I think life has been going pretty good in terms of, like, oh, I got started pretty well, so it's been pretty easy for me to just get down to work. I've been sleeping early and waking up early and just been good, right? Well, for the past few days, and then today, I went out to the furniture store for one of my classes to take pictures for a model, a chair. It kind of branches off, right? So the professor recommended that you go with friends or classmates. He said, 'Take a friend with you.' I didn't take a friend because I like friends here. That just ain't good. Yeah, my friends aren't really on campus. They don't go here. I don't exactly have friends on campus. I just have people that I know, acquaintances. Anyways, so I went over to the furniture store, and the people there were super kind. I was like, 'Oh, I'm here for a class,' and they were super helpful and super nice. I was kind of nervous about that because I was like, 'Oh, what if they see me as going to a furniture store and start measuring things and not actually buy anything or anything like that?' But they were like, 'Oh, you're here for a class,' and all the Gandhi, and they were like, 'Are you from my school?' And I was like, 'Yeah,' and they were like, 'Oh, for the chair class,' and I was like, 'Oh, so you guys, oh,' and it was like, 'Yeah.' It was like a decent conversation, and they were just super nice. So that was great. But yeah, then I came back. It was pretty hot outside, so I took a shower when I came back. And I had a whole plan for today, and it just didn't happen. I sat down and was like, 'I'm going to take a break,' and old habits die hard. I played Overwatch for how long, like, play Overwatch for like five or 6 hours, yeah, like 6 hours maybe. Played essentially until the dining hall is going to close, and as soon as I finish eating, I played some more. Got sick of it, so I'm probably not going to play again for a while, right? Overall, it's just kind of like, 'Yeah, I'm feeling disappointed in myself. I think. Makes sense why I did it. Usually I start gaming when I start feeling bad, but I don't know that I'm feeling bad. Now when I realize, 'Oh, guess I was feeling bad about all this stuff about people.' And yeah, here I am, just kind of saying, and talking. I wanted to talk for a bit because, well, I can only talk to my therapist once a week. And as for my best friend, she doesn't go here. To be honest, not a really good listener or empathizer for her. It's just kind of like, I already don't really share things a lot with the people I'm around. I do share things with my therapist. That's about it. But the fact that she also doesn't really listen, the part of me that already isn't used to talking about things like this to other people is already like, 'No.' And then add that on, it's just kind of like double now, right? It's just kind of like, I can't talk to my brother or my mom. They don't understand. They're like, 'Oh, you go to this great school.' And that just never leaves their subconscious. And I can't really tell my family. They don't understand. It's always the, 'You should be grateful. You're a genius. You're so smart. Do your best. You're great.' And then that's for my therapist. Like, yeah, she's great. Get to talk to her once per week, but usually by the time it gets around to a week, most things happen for some reason between sessions. So by the time I talk to her, I've probably already kind of gotten over any emotions that I might have had. And at least with her, I talked with her don't really seem to evoke that much emotion either. I wonder if I should switch. Probably should. Yeah, essentially, for me, sometimes I offload by journaling. Maybe I should get in a habit of talking to myself. Or something like that evokes emotion. Emotion that I'm not really aware of or used to being aware of. Yeah, I'm sure like before I started gaming, I already felt pretty awful. I just didn't know. Play a game, opening that thing up, and it's just like, everything's so simple in games. It can be hard. But there's just something nice about my alone time. Since I played so much of it, I'm sick of it. It's just like, yeah, I had a whole plan for today. I've been very excited about school. Here I am now. I don't really have anyone to talk to. And the people that I've met here on campus, I don't really have anyone to talk to. I really don't with anyone who is up here, I would say. They're not friends. They're all acquaintances. So, like, you know, the people who probably could understand. Although they also don't, at least the people who understand what it's like to go to a really prestigious school, who would just write me off, right? That's the thing. I try to talk to anyone who doesn't go to the school or like some prestigious school, it's like they think, like, 'Oh my God.' There's a subconscious thing that dismisses me, my problems. And the people who are here who might understand, it's just like, these people are just going through totally different things and also they're not my friends. And then with the few times that I've talked with alumni, people who aren't here anymore at the school, it's always like, they're always like, 'You should talk to your friends about this.' It's like, 'Oh, I guess if I did have something, I guess I wouldn't be talking about some of these things that I'm talking about, right? I don't know. All of these things added up together. It makes sense. I guess now, right? Like why I would be gaming for 6 hours like that. I didn't even have a clue that this was something that was like in my subconscious when I started gaming, right? Honestly, it was just kind of like, 'Hey, this stuff makes me feel fine. Like I'm having fun. Let's do some more.' I was really sorry to feel sick after so many hours of playing. And I was like, 'Okay, I need to go to bed.' But also, I'm going to have a not so fun time sleeping. I can usually go to sleep very easily, right? But ever since school started, I was getting bombarded by all these assignments and all these thoughts about people. Right? It's been on my mind. We're still not at the point where we're struggling to sleep yet, but it's been on my mind. So I was like, 'Okay, I should go to bed. But at this rate, kind of how like I'm bad, I was feeling.' Didn't really know why at the time, I was like, 'Okay. Sit down. Maybe Journal, or maybe talk it out.' And that's why I'm here. Like release some of that negative energy. Well, here I am. It's kind of funny, right? It's a Saturday evening and I'm not going to do a robot. Not that I'm complaining, but feel like most people have plans on this Saturday evening when they're in college. For me, it's just always been me and the best friend that I have. He became best friends online to our interactions online and not through our interactions in person. Yeah, anyways, that was a long-winded point of the story is I had stuff I wanted to do today. Went to the furniture store, got that part of my day done. Got super tired and decided to game for the rest of the day, even though I wanted to do work and other stuff instead, and I felt bad about it. And now I realize it's the reason why I gamed for so long is probably because I've been feeling bad about people.""",3,3
309,168,"My best friend of 20 years got married about 2 months ago. Leading up to the wedding, he was noticably stressed the closer that it got but I, and the 2 other groomsmen, helped to make it the best experience possible. We've all known each other for a long time. When we got there we caught up with the groom's parents and other family members and took several pictures. 

The ceremony was beautiful, although it was very hot outside that day. So hot by the way, that the groom blacked out and lost his footing during the exchange of vows! He ended up being ok and the incident only lasted about 3 seconds, but he continued right on. The ceremony was set outside right in front of a gorgeous lake but it was easily 102° that day. I was paired with the groom's sister, so we were introduced together when we walked into the reception hall. That was a lot of fun. 

During the reception, the fun really began. There was plenty of food, music, and drinks. Our table of the groomsmen and bridemaids as well as the parents table got served food first. We had salmon and filet mignon with asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a garlic aioli sauce. 

The night ended around 11:30pm. No one wanted to leave, as we were all having a great time. Everyone was very happy with the way the wedding turned out, especially my best friend, the groom.",2,2
310,169,"I've been dealing with a chronic, ""incurable"" medical condition for around 16 years, but recently, I've discovered something that might be a potential cure. They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. 

Looking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, ""New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese"" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. 

It turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. 

But why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",3,3
311,1693,"My husband and I got married when we were both very young, halfway through college. We had met right before we started college. He had a football scholarship, and I thought that money was dumb, so I really wasn't very interested in him. But we had a mutual friend who introduced us, and he thought I was going to be a snob. He thought, after he met me, that I had a boyfriend already because there was another guy from Rice who was at the same church camp that we went to. But we quickly connected when we got to college and were engaged two years later. If either one of my daughters had wanted to get married at that young age, I was not quite 20, and he was just past 20, I would have been horrified. But I think we grew together. Our wedding was a small wedding in Littlefield, the town where I lived. My mother wanted to do the reception at our house, so we did the reception there. We had lots of friends that came for the wedding, so we got to see friends and show them my hometown. I remember being upset that I wanted to go swimming with everybody the day of the wedding, and my mother wouldn't let me because she said I would mess up my hair, which it was true. I would have, and I might have gotten sunburned. So she was probably right. The night of our wedding, we drove to New Mexico. We were both poor, halfway through college, so poor college students. We had borrowed my brother's tent, a pup tent with no floor and not quite long as Fred, so his feet stuck out, and we had to just put sleeping bags down on the ground. Pretty soon after we got to Houston, back to school, we took our wedding money, which, if I'm not mistaken, was something like $60, and bought a $45 tent, which we used over and over again, and a $15 ice cream maker. We really thought we were flush to buy those things.",2,2
312,1694,"So, when I was a little girl, I was born in Memphis, Tennessee, but then my father, who was a dentist, went to a special public health program in Atlanta. When the house was finished, we moved into our own house, but I still loved to go up to the upper story and kept some toys at my great aunt's house. One of my jobs was to look for bad spots in apples from the apple trees and throw away the ones with bad spots. If they had a lot of good on them, I would bring them downstairs for apple pies or applesauce. I had to share a bedroom with my little sister, so in the summertime, I liked to go up there and sleep, leaving our family house to go next door to my aunt's. Every summer, I moved all of our stuff up there. We found out later that there was one room that was never finished out, making a good Halloween story since nobody ever knew what was in that room. After we were married, my husband tried to look through the window with a ladder, but the curtains were drawn, so we still don't know what was in it. My friend bought the house after we moved and completely redid it, so I avoided asking what was in the top room.",2,2
313,1695,"This isn't really a story about one of my travels, but I was thinking I would like to talk about collections today when I was a little girl. We lived in Tennessee, and my father had been a botany major at the University of Tennessee before he went to dental school. In the fifth grade, we had to make all kinds of collections. My father helped me make a mineral collection by getting samples from a geologist friend. The samples made it easy for me to put together a collection, and I got a really good grade because there were a lot of them.

The next collection we had to make was of leaves, and I decided I would do this one by myself with just a little help. I ended up having over 100 leaves, even though we were only required to have 20. One memorable leaf was from a ginkgo tree on the University of Tennessee campus. There were so many kinds of trees in East Tennessee that it was easy to come up with 100 leaves and I got a good grade on that too.

When we moved to Texas and I got to high school, we also had to make collections. I used my mineral and leaf collections from fifth grade because they were pretty and I had worked hard on them. I got A's on both collections again. This time, we had to make an insect collection, and I enjoyed it because I like insects. I collected around 50 or 60 insects by capturing them in a jar and freezing them, thinking it would kill them. However, that night, while I was pinning the insects to a Styrofoam board in my brother's room, many of them revived. Grasshoppers were hopping around, wasps were flying, and I learned the hard way that freezing is not a good way to kill bugs.",2,2
314,170,"I will admit that not that many exciting or memorable things happen to me a lot, but this really hit me hard. I don't date a lot, not because I don't want to but because I just never seem to find someone. Finally I met someone. She is and was everything that I was looking for. Interesting and fun and someone I can talk to for hours. 

I told her some things that had happened to me in the past, stuff I just don't tell anyone. This was over the messaging program discord and she stopped me. She was quiet for a moment and I was worried I did something wrong. After a while she started talking. Telling me something that was horrific that happened to her when she was younger. 

I had no idea this had happened, she never even brought it up slightly to me before. I listened while she talked and I wanted to cry. Not for me but for her and that she had been holding on to something for so long. I wish we lived closer so I could properly comfort her, but instead I thanked her for telling me about it. 

It made me realize how close we actually were. I could trust her and she could trust me.",3,3
315,1704,"So when I was done at the Climate notch, I met an individual who was working for a group that I really liked, and they invited me to join the script that looks at the transition of fossil fuels away from being used in a manner that encourages an increase in their use. I was fortunate enough to be invited to a group that is looking at it from multiple angles, and what I find fascinating is the drive they have, the passion they have, even at the age they're at, towards a cause that is important to me right now. A lot of the people in this group are in their sixties and seventies, and I hope is important to me as time goes on. To be able to do something towards the cause in your elder years, I think, is very admirable because a lot of people become very closely attached to their material accumulation and become fearful of losing what they have or having less tomorrow than what they do today. But having met a group like this is going to allow me to keep on honing my tribe towards working as a problem solver and topics that are important to me.",2,2
316,1706,"All right, so I wanted to share about my childhood trauma, and the experience we have as a child shapes who we are as an adult. Internally, I think we all still have that child inside. I think internal development happens slowly, unlike the outside. It's really important to understand ourselves. One thing I vividly remember is when I was five or six years old, I walked home from ballet school. The distance seemed short from the bus. To me, it seemed like ten minutes by bus, but walking, it would take much longer. I realized I got lost when the streets looked unfamiliar and widened. I started to enter a highway, with fast cars and a narrow sidewalk. I hoped for help but no one did until a car pulled over. A guy asked if I was lost, and being a kid made me comfortable. He took me to the police station and I got home safely.

This story reflects my brave and adventurous personality, but also my tendency to underestimate things. I used to wait for others to help me instead of being proactive. This pattern continued until my early twenties. I realized that being proactive and finding solutions on my own is important. That's the difference between me as an adult and as a young kid.",2,2
317,1707,"All right, so I wanted to talk about my pack, the experience I had with my pets. I think pets are a very important part of my adolescence and childhood. Now, I don't have pets anymore. I'm more of a plant person. But when I was young, I had birds, hamsters, and dogs. So, I really loved animals as a young kid and adolescent, especially today. I want to talk about my first pet, a dog. I think the first experience is very meaningful because you are doing it for the first time, so it's very special. Also, it's more likely that you'll make a lot of mistakes, so it's likely that you will remember it longer, maybe have some regrets. So anyway, I think the first experience is very important. So, I'll share a story about how I had my first dog. When I was about nine years old, it was a summer day, late in the evening. It was raining heavily at the moment. So I took my umbrella and headed out from home. I lived in an apartment at the time. As soon as the elevator opened, I saw a wet dog, a little dog soaked in the rain. It was small but looked poor and was shaking because of the cold. It didn't move and just kept making eye contact with me. I thought, ""Oh my gosh, I have to run back and bring a dry towel."" So I took the elevator back to my home. I brought a dry towel. The dog was still there, still shaky, but looked meek. I approached it, wrapped it with a towel. I didn't resist or bark. I pet the dog. I looked into its eyes; it was so cute and poor. I wanted to bring the dog back home, but my mom didn't like dogs. She never had a dog before. I didn't remember her reaction, but we decided to keep the dog. I started to build a bond with my first dog in elementary school. I would bring junk food and feed the dog joyfully. I would go out with the dog; it was like my very good friend. The dog started to grow, started making messes. Peeing, chewing furniture. My mom was annoyed. One day, I realized the dog was missing. She told me she sent the dog to a relative's house with a big yard. I was angry and sad. I cried all day. She said we could visit the dog. A week later, she said the dog ran away from their family, and now the dog was missing. My last hope was gone. I always thought the dog would find a way back to me. I would pray before bed for the dog to find a way back, but it never happened. I always wondered what happened to my first dog.",3,3
318,1708,"So today, I wanted to share a story about one of my friends from childhood. Her name was Tajong, and ""Tajang"" means kindness and sweetness in Korean, just like her name indicates. She was a very nice and kind person. My friend, when I was like eight or nine years old, was much more mature than all the other kids who were the same age. She was almost like an older sister to me, very nice and kind. Whenever we met to play together, she gave me a small gift, like a scented eraser. She was always adjusting her schedule to mine, coming to play in my neighborhood. Every time she would come to play, we had a great time. One day, she didn't show up, so I got mad. Later, I found out she was moving to another city. She gave me a handwritten letter as a parting gift. I felt empty and lonely without her, and I regretted not appreciating her more. The drawer in my desk was full of the scented erasers she gave me. I regretted not giving her any gifts. Even after several years, I could never forget her name, Tajong. I always missed her even though we couldn't contact each other. She was a very kind and sweet person, showing big heart and friendship towards me.",3,3
319,1709,"Today, I wanted to share a story about my grandmother on my father's side. I wasn't very close with her growing up because she seemed cold and reserved, rarely talking. Scared of her, I felt more at ease with my mother's parents. When my father's stroke left him half paralyzed and unable to speak, it made visits awkward. But when my family moved them near us, I began visiting every weekend. Despite our silence, I felt grandma's warmth as she smiled at me. When I moved to Canada, I called home often and was urged to speak with grandma, who surprised me by crying. This emotional moment made me realize her adoration for me. When I returned to South Korea, I visited her more regularly, growing closer during my high school years. College separated us, but visits during breaks became treasured moments. When she fell ill with cancer, my fear of death kept me from visiting her in the hospice until I finally sat by her side. She passed away the next day, and I regretted not visiting more. Her love for me became clear, and her absence weighed heavily on me. Reflecting on her life, I realized how lonely it must have been for her, caring for my grandfather. In a dream, she appeared vibrant and happy, bringing me comfort and relieving my guilt. Seeing her well and happy in my dream helped me find solace and wish her peace and happiness.",3,3
320,171,"This event is, quite simply, just a conversation I had with my wife about our future. It was a happy conversation that just happened randomly, about a month ago. We were plopped on our couch and just resting when my wife started a conversation about our future, about having our first baby. I was engaged. 

We started discussing how he or she would look like, who we want it to look like, how we will raise our child, and how fun (and simultaneously stressful) it would be to be a parent. It was a very meaningful and satisfying conversation. 

We normally don't have time available to just sit and talk like that. We live pretty busy lives. But that moment was really significant, because it meant something to us and what our future will be as husband and wife. 

We talked about how we have been married for over three years already, and we already enjoyed most of our time with just the two of us. It may be time for a new member to join in. We feel quite ready. 

I told her however if we can wait just a few more months before trying. I just want to have one more special anniversary to spend with her, then we can finally go for it. She agreed. 

It was a special time we shared having that conversation. It means a lot to us to share what we think openly, and be very loving and understanding of our thoughts and feelings. 

This event is something we would definitely look back at once we have our first kid.",2,2
321,1710,"So, since we are talking about moving to a new place, I wanted to share my story about my history of my relocation and how my perspective in life has changed since then. I've been living in different countries since I was young, in Canada, India, and now in the US, originally born and raised in South Korea, so I've lived in four different countries. I also traveled to many different countries like Japan, Europe, and Southeast Asia. I guess I enjoyed a nomadic lifestyle because I am a person with a lot of curiosity and like exploring something new. The excitement of exploring new places outweighs the desire to settle down and feel stable. Part of my changed perspective is because I've moved three times this year already and I'm tired of packing and unpacking. I'm more focused on my career development and expertise now, and feel like I've found a career and a job I can dedicate my life to. I want my environment to be more stable in order to do a better job at what I'm doing. My taste has been developing, I have lots of books, magazines, photography equipment, drawing tablets, and computer for video editing. It's annoying to bring all these things around, so I want to settle down. I really want to buy land and build my own house to reflect my personality and interests in the next couple of years. I still need to figure out where I want to settle down, number one homework before purchasing a house. My perspective and lifestyle have evolved from a nomadic one to someone seeking more stability in settlement.",2,2
322,1712,"Today, I'd like to share how my perspective on happiness changed throughout my life. Since I was really young, I kinda knew how difficult life would be, with a lot of responsibilities and pain involved. As I grew up, I wanted to avoid pain and pursue only happiness. For me, happiness meant status without pain, with only joy and pleasure. So as a teenager and college student, I hated doing things I didn't want to do, like studying subjects I wasn't interested in. I only wanted to study things I enjoyed. This mindset hindered my growth because I always avoided painful situations. Looking back, I understand that now. Since I was young, I was interested in Buddhism, which talked about breaking out of painful life and reaching endless peace. In my early 20s, I practiced Buddhism, including meditation. My perspective on happiness slowly changed as I was exposed to military content. The popularity of ex-Navy SEALs and army officers inspired me to embrace pain and go through difficult situations willingly. My interest shifted to MMA fighters and UFC, who go through tough training. I realized my level of happiness never changes. Achieving goals only brings temporary joy. When my environment changed, I thought I would be miserable forever, but I got used to it after a few days. I realized happiness is always with me, regardless of life's ups and downs. Painful experiences help me realize that I'll always be okay. I don't need to avoid pain or pursue happiness. That's how my perspective on happiness evolved over the years.",2,2
323,1714,"I have a friend who recently lost his father due to a tragic car accident. I heard this news on a day of going for dinner. I felt really bad for my friend because I know how kind and sweet of a person he is. Although I haven't seen his father, I could see that he must have grown in a very happy family. He talked about his father a couple of times, so I know that he loves his family and his father. I know how difficult it would be for him. It was very difficult for me as well, thinking about it. I feel like nothing could comfort him in this situation. I felt really bad that I could not do much for him. It got me to think about my own family. How would I feel if my dad suddenly passed away? I couldn't even imagine that. I have a really good relationship with my dad, and I talk with him about everything. Losing someone that important, that close, who supports you and made you actually would be unimaginable. I've experienced that with my grandparents, but I think it's very different from losing your parents. It got me thinking about relationships and death in life. I think it's inevitable. I will die someday and see my parents die someday. So, I should always take the moments in time preciously because it's not going to last forever. This tragic event with my friend got me thinking a lot about those kinds of philosophical questions. Sometimes, just thinking about that makes me feel so humble and makes me feel like everything is less important than I am actually thinking it is. But yeah, I don't know how to... I guess I'm trying to think on a brighter side. It can also broaden my perspective somehow and embrace the difficult moments in life as more grateful. I was very heartbroken to hear my friend's youth. Yeah, I just thought I wanted to share this story to hear what you think about.",3,3
324,1715,"Okay, so this isn't really anything exciting, it's not an exciting story, but it's something that I learned recently about myself, so I thought it'd be interesting to share. Wait, let me take a look at my note. When I was younger, I really wanted to achieve something in life really fast and be recognized as a successful person, so I had this very big desire. Naturally, I searched for a field or area where I thought I had a competitive advantage, and one of the fields or professions that I found I could do better than other people was in the creative writing field. I got a lot of compliments from teachers and family and friends about my writing skills or my imagination. In my early twenties, I wanted to become a famous novelist, a successful TV scriptwriter, or a filmmaker, so I did internships and worked as a writer at a radio station, a production company, and a youth agency. But I didn't last long in those fields because I was so impatient and wanted to be this famous writer, but I was just a low-paying freelance writer and couldn't bear the difficulties. I called it quits and jumped to another industry. Looking back, I realize I was immature and impatient at the time. If I was a little bit wiser, I would have seen those struggles and difficulties as learning opportunities to grow. Now I'm in a completely different field not related to writing, although writing is essential in all kinds of work and industry. I've learned my lesson from past experiences, and although today I felt like my younger self was feeling agitated about who I am right now and was comparing myself to who I want to be in the future, I try to remind myself of the outcome that I had with that kind of mentality. I'm trying to reinforce myself in a more positive way and enjoy the moment rather than jump to the end result. I'm trying to be grateful about my surroundings and who I am right now. It's good for my mind and gives me motivation and energy to continue to work on my future goals.",2,2
325,1725,"Cool. So today, I was looking at photos of some friends, it was a friend's birthday today. I was looking at photos from maybe ten years, from 2006 to probably 2014. I guess maybe somewhere around there. Anyways, I was just thinking about how my friends and I used to go hike in college, have fun, and build forts. We were already old, but it was still fun to do that. I was sending some photos to some other friends, and I was just thinking about a vacation that we went on in high school, that was wild and fun. It was just interesting to see photos of us from when we were younger. It made me think of how young we were, how young I was, and how much we've all grown. We look different, we were different. We were closer friends then, and now we're all grown up. Some of my friends are lawyers, and I work in artificial intelligence. It was just interesting to look back on those photos today and back on photos throughout my life. But particularly on the photos of my friends. It's nice, I guess, to remember being so close to those people, even though we were all young and it was messy. We weren't responsible adults, emotionally or in any other way. But it was nice to be so close with my friends during those years past.",2,2
326,1726,"Yeah, so I was talking with my father last night, and he was repeating himself a lot. He mentioned that his wife is concerned about his cognitive decline in terms of dementia. Some of my earlier memories were with my grandfather, his father, who had Alzheimer's, and he lived in our house. It was pretty brutal to see him losing his mind. But I told my father that I don't think it's related to Alzheimer's or Dementia. I think he just lacks intellectual or emotional stimulation. He doesn't engage in conversations, participate in social events, or ask questions to learn about people. He has no interest in using a computer, buying a plane ticket, traveling alone, or managing his finances. He essentially does nothing. In my opinion, his lack of participation and cognitive processes are a self-fulfilling process of his decline. There are older people I know who love learning, cooking, reading, hiking, and exploring ways to stay active and healthy. My father prefers sitting on the couch, jogging, and drinking beer. It's been that way his whole life. It's annoying to hear him say, ""Oh, Jamie's worried about me,"" when it's really due to his own preferences and behaviors.",3,3
327,1734,"Are you listening? Right now, I guess I'll start, I'm not sure if you're listening, I guess. The two most meaningful stories we can start out with are from the beginning. I can tell you the story of my adoption: I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and at about the age somewhere between eight to 15 months, I was abandoned on post office steps and then taken to an orphanage, where my adoption was arranged for my family at about 21 months. From what I know, I was abandoned on post office steps and then taken to an orphanage, and then my family was tracked down. I was told that my birth father was deceased and my birth mother couldn't take care of me. After they had contacted my family, my birth uncle tried to take care of me, but he just couldn't handle it, so then I was released for the adoption process. So, at about 21 months, I came over to the United States to my current loving, loving family. I feel very fortunate and I never kind of felt empty inside about the whole adoption. I get a little emotional just talking about it because honestly, it feels very surreal. I've always had a very loving family and so there's nothing that I should be feeling bad about. I was lucky to have my parents have two biological children, John and Betsy, who are about eight and nine years older than me, so I was definitely the baby of the family, but I never grew up feeling different. In fact, sometimes I joke that I'm just a white girl, which might seem a little derogatory, but I have never felt different or undervalued in my life. Well, from this, if anything, I feel very blessed and fortunate to have landed where I did and all the immense opportunities that have been before me. I really, honestly couldn't feel luckier about the family that I had.",3,3
328,1736,"I'll do a part two to my adoption story, something that surfaced when I was about 25 years old, quite a while after my adoption. I took a graduate study and we traveled to Korea, my first time back to Seoul, South Korea, since my adoption. I don't know if I've had that many emotions running through me at any other point in my life. It was just such a blend of elevated highs of feeling connected and moments of pure peace to extreme disruption with who I identified with up until that point. I even took a little medallion that was from when I came over, with the name of my orphanage, and had a cab driver take me there. I saw all the kids there and they showed me a picture of myself that I had never seen before. It completely threw me into a complete unraveling, having panic attacks for a good two weeks plus after that, where I couldn't breathe, and didn't know who I was or where I was supposed to be going. It took a long time for me to kind of situate myself back to ""I am a blend of everything. I'm not just one or the other."" I don't have to feel guilty or wonder about my birth family and where they are, but it really did take a long time for me to calm down my emotions so I wasn't having panic attacks anymore. I still feel like it has a bit of a ripple effect.",3,3
329,1738,"I don't know if it's interesting. I'm kind of gearing more towards emotional triggers in my storytelling about having to work with a really aggressive coworker. So I have a product manager who is, I can flat out say, the most aggressive teammate I've ever had to deal with. The way that I started to handle it was first to be overly appeasing and make sure that she felt included. It just continued, this perpetual sort of resentment towards me. I'm not really sure where that's founded in. she just had something she didn't like about me and brought it to a personal level rather than keeping it professional. I tried to have heart-to-hearts with her and it seemed on the surface that everything was fine. But it's really just constant and perpetual condescending tones, outright aggression, and honestly, very childish behavior. The outcome is just that thankfully the teams have shuffled and I shouldn't have to have any overlap with her. I've brought it up to my boss, my manager, and he's fully aware of it. We have such a limited fund and appetite for hiring new people. The only resolution is to basically not have to overlap with her in work.",2,2
330,174,"I have been in this ATM business racket for many many years. I got my start in a great company but like many others say appreciate what you have now because one day it can be gone. In this case though I have to say don't always look back at memories and be prepared for what's to come. The company that I loved to work for got bought out by a major conglomerate in the business. We all were worried about losing our jobs which they assured was not the case. 

Sometimes some things are better left unsaid. My entire department was let go in one swoop but were picked up by another service company in the same industry. We all knew we were just buying time at that point and i noticed one by one several of my coworkers were going their own way. 

Luckily for me i was headhunted by my former manager to another job which i didn't think was a great opportunity at the time. In the mean time of all this moving I was keen on becoming part of this company I've always been fond of, some of my coworkers even started working there. 

For 2 years i applied and most of the time did not receive a response. Then one day the call came, I was so excited i ran around my block with joy. The salary they promised was so outstanding and just the fact i would work with familiar faces made me so excited. 

To this day i love where i work, and I even intend on going to college to further pursue my career within the company. How my life changed since that day is something i will never forget. I will always never forget the path it took to get here and most importantly how God was able to guide me.",2,2
331,1741,"I guess recently, I don't know if I've been talking about the lack of security at my job because we're a venture-backed kind of product company. We really rely on outside financing to help support our growth and development. There's been a lot of uncertainty now with this last venture capitalist backing, investment opportunity, whether or not our company is going to survive. I've been dealing a lot with the nervousness about job security. I reached out to my friend who works at another product design company. There's a really great potential opportunity over there. I feel like I'm my own worst enemy. I weigh the balances, which I guess is normal, but at the same time sometimes I already talk myself out of opportunities before I even jump into them because I'm weighing all the outcomes and seeing outcomes that probably don't even exist. Maybe just looking for reasons not to lean into something. I struggle with this. It sounds perfect and great, but it's kind of a whole 100% remote, and so, I just already have predetermined in my mind that for the rest of my life, I'm going to be working at home in my office by myself. I shouldn't just talk myself out of good opportunities.",2,2
332,1745,"I have a job interview coming up, and I had maybe 15 different recruiters reach out to me about it, with a bunch giving the same cap for what the company would pay. There's a contract rule, but it's Google and they can pay so much more since I live in the heart of Boston. It's not just a typical research role, it's a team lead role. Dealing with the recruiters is its own beast, but they're there to hopefully gain success through my success, so that's good. Sometimes you have to wonder how transparent they're being about budget, but it's a cool opportunity with a lot of competition and it's contract. I have mixed feelings about that, but since I'm still not really sure of my next direction, I should see where things take me. I have to be discerning, otherwise I just pick up an available job, which is not what I want. I like to pride myself on the opportunities I select, and hopefully, girlfriend... I'm needing to refresh myself in some of my old work because I have had so many different jobs and projects that really vary but are still within UX, user research, Psychology, perception, and design research. There are so many different directions I can take myself in the field still, which is exciting.",2,2
333,175,"My family and I just came back from a camping trip yesterday. I wanted to do one last mini vacation before my child started school today. It was a great 3 day weekend. On Friday my family and I left for our camping trip to Perris Lake in Perris, California. Perris is 2 hours away from us so we actually went and stayed with a friend on Friday that lived one hour away from the lake. 

On Saturday was the start of our camping trip. It was hot, 105 plus degree temperatures everyday, trust me I will never forget that. Good thing the lake was not too far from the campsite. We went with 5 of our friends. The best thing was my child got to to see one of her friends that she had not seen over a year because they moved four hours away. I had a great time. The lake was nice and refreshing. We had a couple of canoes with us so we went out exploring the lake. We had great food from the grill and fresh fruits to keep us fresh because of the heat. 

The last night, on Sunday there was a storm off in the distance. We had a great lighting storm and a little wind. Luckily, it did not rain. I know now not to go camping here in the late summer because the heat was too much for me, I had mixed feeling from this camping trip because I was happy to be around some great friends I had not seen in while but the heat was awful.",2,2
334,1750,"All right? So, my story is that I got to catch up with my friend today. It was really nice talking about different trips we've taken in the past. Other trips we might want to take in the future. And also just finding out the best way to plan for taking a trip with her because she has a baby. I'm friends with her husband, but it's different when you're single and you're figuring out how to hang out with your friends. Go on trips with them when they aren't single. And it makes sense this time of my life. I mean, I've got friends that have kids going to college. I've got friends that have kids they just had. And of course, people like myself, like I was just mentioning. But it was really good. So, the story is that I met up with her for lunch. And she was telling me also about how she's going through IVF right now to get pregnant again. And so, that was also really interesting because I've gone through my own process of trying to cryogenically freeze my own eggs. Which I've done in the past after my husband passed away. So, I have some experience in that, not in the implanting stage. The fertilization stage. But she's having to inject all these hormones into her right now. And I've gone through that and can commiserate. It can change you not just physically. But mentally too. So, it's good we can share different past experiences. Whether it's her experience going to Sedona. Or my experience with IVF. Just a lot to talk about. A lot of different kinds of topics. And she's a fun friend to discuss a lot of different topics with.",2,2
335,1752,"So this is a story of how my mom and dad got married, they have a super cute love story that I wish I will have. They grew up on the same little street in a tiny farming fishing village in China, just a few houses apart. My mom is two years older than my dad, but he fell in love with her from birth. She was the class star, President, role model, most beautiful girl ever. He followed her around, made dumb jokes, but she kind of liked them a little bit. When he left for the US at twelve, they didn't see each other for six years. He wrote letters and kept loving her. He deferred a semester to go back to China for College, and saw my mom first thing. He just knew. He asked her to come to America and eventually marry him. She agreed, never dating anyone before. My maternal grandma was strict about boys. They were each other's first kiss, everything. Very bold and brave of my mom to move to America with my dad. They got married at 20 and 22, married for over 30 years now. I admire that. I hope to find someone soon. That is the story of how my mom fell in love, got married, and had six years of marriage before having me. A little marriage time before kids is nice. Thank you, Jibo.",2,2
336,1753,"So this past weekend, I went to my first wedding ever. The groom was my peer mentor, the one that introduced me to MIT and the dorm we lived in. He took care of me and my friends. The bride was in my year but one year younger. They met through shared interests. The ceremony was outside, with cute vows that almost made me cry a lot. The reception got to me. Both dads gave beautiful speeches and their first dance was touching. The friend group, except for the guys, were crying. It made me think about my future wedding, partner, and marriage. The couple isn't on their honeymoon yet, as she has a conference first. It's crazy how life can change fast. I flew in Saturday morning and commuted an hour and a half to a nice udon place. I'm not famous, but kind of. I spent 2 hours getting ready. Dressing up was fun, catching up, spilling some tea. We made our way to the hotel for the wedding. A lot of us didn't know what to do and arrived too early. It was still fun. I ran into random people I knew and extended my trip because I loved it. That was the story of the first wedding I've ever been to.",2,2
337,1754,"Yeah, so the story I'm going to share today is about my family's move from Hino, Texas. My favorite part about that house, besides family, was that on the front lawn, the sidewalk, there my sister and I have our handprints in the cement. So they redid our sidewalk at some point. But as kids, we were like, ""Ha, ha. Wouldn't it be so funny if we left our mark in the cement on the sidewalk here, just to mark our place, that we were here?"" So each of us put our right hand down into the cement when it was so, not wet, but not dry either, and left little handprints there. It's been like ten years now, and I still think about our handprints there, but eventually my family did move. I was very sad at first because we were taking out all the furniture, repainting the walls. When we left, the house just felt so empty, like foreign, like a shell of itself. I didn't recognize it after we painted the walls white. Everything was echoing, and I was like, ""Wow, I grew up here. This is no longer home."" Part of me thought we would always have this home for the rest of my life to come back to. But then we moved to our new house in Allen, Texas. I really quickly adjusted to it because the furniture was the same. Obviously, home is where my parents are. So if they move again, that will be my new home. But now I love our new home a lot; it's much bigger, much more comfortable. Interestingly, I still dream sometimes about my old home, dreams where I mix my old home and my new home's architectural layout. It's confusing, but the move was fun. We started in COVID summer, so I was home. Luckily, we're just moving things back and forth with our cars. The move itself was not too bad; it was definitely a bonding moment within our family to move our stuff ourselves. What do you think? So, yeah. We moved. Now that's my new home. I know that my parents will eventually move at least one more time. They will probably downsize their home once the grandkids are older enough that they don't need to visit and have their own guest rooms. So, I'm excited for that. Oh, no. Another home missing. But yes, the story. That was the story of my family moving from one house to another house.",3,3
338,1755,"So today, my story is about the movie I watched yesterday, named Joyride. I think it was really interesting because when they first introduced the characters, I was actually a little bit upset. I was like, ""Why are they getting a Korean girl to play a Chinese girl?"" Right? I understand Asian American representation is really important, especially in media nowadays. But later, spoiler alert, there's a twist. It turns out she was supposed to be Korean. So I was like, ""Whoa, it's so nice that they actually got ethnicities correct."" So I changed my mind about casting. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was about finding out who you are. The storyline goes that there's this fancy lawyer who was adopted from China, trying to find her birth mother. They go through a crazy adventure and eventually end up in Korea. She finds out that her birth mother was Korean and had passed away. It tested their friendship. They did a lot of really crazy things while in East Asia. But overall, I think it was a pretty beautiful message of friendship and how family and your identities are what you make of it, and at the end of the day, just love your people who love you. So I really enjoyed the movie. It's really, really funny at times. Really emotional sometimes, I definitely cried a little bit at one point when the deceased mother was wishing her daughter well. And it kind of inspired me, too. I think I also want to go on like a soul-searching journey. Yes, that is my story.",3,3
339,1758,"So, I'm actually going to be flying home in 3 hours, or leaving for the airport in 3 hours to fly home, and something I've been super excited for—cannot wait. Definitely miss my parents a lot. My younger sister is in New York, so she won't be home, but going home will be good for me because I really need the rest. I think something that's really hard to do as an adult is to pace yourself, because when you're in school, you have semesters, you have projects that you know when they'll end, so you have better timelines to fulfill. Like, ""Oh, you know, in two weeks, then you have an exam and then you have a period of free time,"" but until then, you're working hard. But in grad school, I feel like there's just no end, so if you need a break, you have to really go take that break for yourself. For us, you just won't have that break. So the last time I was home was probably early June for two days, home trips are very short. Now I miss having a full week at home, a whole actual vacation. So being able to go home for just like three days this weekend will be very helpful, healing, good for my soul. Yeah, I am most excited to eat my mom's food, to go shopping, to feel like a kid again. I feel like life is very tiring and pressurising, to be able to let loose and let someone take care of me for a little bit will be nice. I did try to take care of my parents as well, I bring them gifts, I listen to them when they're lonely, and I hope that their parents can take good care of them when my grandparents are in China, so they're not really close by. It's a very different relationship between my mom and her mom, which is my mom and me, but I'm so grateful for my family, everything about it. So yeah, I left lab a little early today to catch my flight, talking to you now before Doica's over or the week begins, and yeah, I'll be sad when I come back, but I'm mostly looking forward to going home first. Yeah.",3,3
340,1759,"Tuesday, yeah. So this Tuesday, I played squash for the very first time, and today's Friday, so it's been three days and I'm still very sore from it. But it was my first time really trying something new in a while. I played with a couple of upperclassmen, and as a perfectionist, it's really hard for me to show my failure weakness. But what was really nice about the whole situation was that everyone was super friendly, even though I kept missing the ball, and it really made me feel a lot better about myself. I can't explain how silly it sounds, but for my upperclassmen friends to be so supportive of me, messing up, failing, and being nice playing the ball was really nice. When the guys played against each other, they were like, ""swing real hard, the ball is going so fast, so hard."" But when they played against me and another girl, they were a lot easier on us, which is kind of gentlemanly of them, I think. Yeah. The point was that I was able to fail a lot and be really bad at a sport and not feel really ashamed of it, so it was a really good first experience, and I definitely will play again sometime (unsure when) because I'm still so sore, and it did take a very long time to get there. But overall, I really enjoyed the experience. So that was the story of me playing squash for the first time and not being afraid of not being perfect.",2,2
341,176,"I saw a movie that I enjoyed so much I saw it three times in the last week. I first went to it alone. Then I went to it with my husband. Then I took my girlfriend to see it last night. The movie was about an event that was a fantasy and yet totally believable. The characters were sweet and lovely and they made you want to know what happened to them and you really cared about what happened. The music in the movie was so phenomenal and kept you on the edge of your seat. I also had acquired the tickets for a really good price. That made it more justifiable to see it so many times. 

I intend to buy the movie when it becomes available. I may see it again soon with my son who wants to see it too and has not done so yet. The movie just makes me happy when I see it because of the joyfulness. The way they overcome their challenges with love and understanding is so lovely. It makes you want to persevere in the things you love as well. 

The actors that portrayed the characters in the movie were remarkable. They were so realistic that you totally believed what was happening to them. They also were humorous and had many friends. Movies that include friendship and love are so rare nowadays and that was refreshing. The fact that they were not white Americans was surprising but surprisingly a very good choice. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet. 

It was a fantasy and yet a believable story. The story was just a remarkable way of showing perseverance and love with ordinary people. I hope that the movie academy of arts and sciences will consider it for some award. It was a brilliant concept and a wonderful story to impart to all ages. I've been telling everyone I know about the movie now.",3,3
342,1764,"One of the prompts was to talk about a movie that meant something to you. When I was in high school, in the late 60s, this is when all the counterculture types were really into Tolkien and that was the first time that he became a phenomenon in this country. I was into it and just devoured the book, which made a big impression on me. I never dreamed that it would be possible to translate these books into film, but when the Peter Jackson movies came out, the special effects were more advanced and I think that Peter Jackson did a magnificent job with a story just true to Tolkien's vision. The actors were all just top notch. However, the single most memorable scene for me wasn't necessarily one of the big battle set pieces, but it was right at the beginning of the first movie when Gandalf weiss's cart into town and sees Frodo waiting alongside the road. Gandalf asks Frodo, ""Get in the cart. We'll go into town together."" And he does. Ian McKellen as Gandalf looks at Frodo and smiles at him with such unbelievable love, which just blows off the screen. You could see that Tolkien would have adored this portrayal of Gandalf. It's interesting that Ian McKellen just doesn't take acting all that seriously and has been on variety shows where he says, ""Well, somebody else writes the lines. I just stand where I'm supposed to stand and read."" But he is a summit actor and what he did with no words at all, just facial expressions, brought a whole Lord of the Rings feel of it in such an immediate way. I never forgot that.",3,3
343,177,"Two years ago my mom passed away. It was the worst day of my life, and a day I will never forget. It was very unexpected and traumatic. It was a Sunday morning, and I got the call from my dad who told me she had passed. I just remember screaming, and not really being able to do much else. I told my husband and we both just cried and cried. 

I couldn't believe what was happening and was too young to lose my mom. I remember collapsing while trying to pack to fly to where she and my dad lived. I had a young daughter at the time and my heart was breaking for her that she would never get to know my mom. And that my mom wouldn't be able to get to know her. 

I mourned at the lost time and the major events my mom would not be a part of. It was heartbreaking. The rest of the day was a big blur, as I just went through the motions and didn't even really remember much. When we got to my parents house, we were surrounded by family and friends, but I felt so lonely. 

I remember just going into her room, and crying thinking how could this be happening. It was the worst day, and even 2 years later, it still is hard to breathe when I think about it. She died from pneumonia. Something that happens all the time to people, but it took my mom. Emotionally it has been so daunting. Losing someone you love that much is so hard, and is not something you ever get over. 

The days get easier to get through, but that moment is always in the back of your mind, and the person lost is always thought of.",3,3
344,1770,"I think I've mentioned that I have a cat named Zoro, right? His name is Zoro. I adopted him when my other cat was about ten years old. Sadly, my other cat passed away a couple of years ago, and he was just super, like the best cat ever. When I got Zoro, he was only five months old. And then, my ex-husband, he got home before me from grad school. His brother had come over and he wasn't paying attention, and Zoro slipped out of the front door. It was terrifying. The doorway is very narrow, so you really have to not be paying attention to have Zoro slip by. I was scared because I was living in Florida, and my apartment was near a nature conservation area. There are dangerous animals like gators, alligators, venomous snakes, and even hawks that could be predators to Zoro. He was small enough to be prey for a hawk, and that was really close to my door. I looked everywhere for him. He didn't come back. So, the next day, I put on rain boots, tucked in my pants, put on a sweatshirt, and a bandana over my face. I went into the nature conservation area to find Zoro. It had been 18 hours since he disappeared, but I finally got close enough to the bush he was hiding under and he meowed. It was terrifying. I did run into a gator at one point, but I backed away slowly and thankfully, it didn't act aggressive. I was really worried. But I found him, and Zoro is with me today. I'm very glad it worked out.",3,3
345,1774,"Yeah, so this is the beginning of the school year, and I've seen a lot of people moving into their dorms and apartments, and it really got me thinking about when I first went to College, when I was moving into the dorm. How excited my parents were for me and scared. And I was both excited and scared, moving away from home and my parents, and knowing that I'd probably get really homesick. Watching all those kids moving in really made me think about how that felt for me. It was really important for me, there was a lot of pressure for me to do well in College because my dad came here from a developing country and wasn't able to get an education past second grade. I was the first person in my family to go to College, and to make it that far. So I had a lot of emotions, definitely some anxiety, some stress about the pressure of performing and doing well. But also the excitement, and kind of the normal fear that you get doing something you've never done before and not having parents who had never experienced College like that before. I didn't really have anyone to go to, to understand what that meant, like what to expect. So watching those kids just brought me back to that moment.",3,3
346,1779,"Here's my story today, maybe it's more a reflection than a story, but I just wanted to talk to you about my son's 40th birthday. It crept up on me, and that was interesting. He lives in another state, and now he's married with a child. We don't have a day-to-day communication relationship, so we catch each other when we can. Birthdays always make me reminisce about them growing up, both my sons. This one was my younger son. So different. You think about a day that we were born, when you drop them off at kindergarten, their first day, first grade, and on to dropping them off at college and all that, and then their wedding. It's a lot of emotions during the day when they have their birthday, it always seems to happen to me. Now he's 40, and he has his own life, his own family. Our conversations are so different now. It's no longer the parent-child conversation, it's two adults talking. He told me all about how his house is coming along, doing a lot of renovations, has a new job, and wanted to talk about his daughter starting second grade next week. It was all very pleasant. But it's so different. It's just how life evolves over the years, from parent child to a different kind of relationship. It is a little bit like the tables are turning. So a lot of memories in this city, a lot of memories. But that was today. It always happens during their birthdays. So that's my story today.",2,2
347,178,"I almost killed someone last month. I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces.

And then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me.

There was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone.

My bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.

The next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that. My family is broke but I didn't kill someone that day.",3,3
348,1787,"One of my hobbies is origami, and I'm going to tell you about how I started getting into it when I was around 14 or 13. One day, the idea of making a paper dragon popped into my head, so I scoured the internet on YouTube for origami dragon instructions or a tutorial to find a model that looked cool. I settled on some pretty complex models, not really thinking about how difficult it would be to make. Since I had never really done origami before, except for simple paper planes and unpapercrafts, it was very difficult with hundreds of folds made with great precision. I tried over and over for a day, then another, and then a week, maybe 20 or 30 times, each taking hours, and couldn't seem to finish. Even during a journey, I was folding and folding, committing most of the folds to memory.

After about a month of trying, I finally finished making the model, sparking my love for origami and leading me to make many more models. I still enjoy doing origami, wanting to learn to design my own models and study the interesting math behind origami and research in the field. But most of all, I just enjoy the process of folding and creating something with my hands. Once a model is finished, it feels like it's over, and I'm eager to start working on a new one.",2,2
349,1789,"So, I was having a conversation with a friend today about how art is a very essential thing for humans, somewhat like pure expression of human spirit. Unfortunately, we tend to restrict human performers of art to only the very best. The people who become painters are the best at painting, the people who are musicians are the best at music, and so on. Project Trooper talked about participatory music, where the audience is part of the music as well. It's just a thing that people do, as opposed to being an exclusive stage for professional musicians. My friend brought up this study, which I thought was really interesting. In an Indigenous community in Peru, music-making is highly participatory, and an ethnomusicologist conducted a study there once. Any male community member is welcome to perform with pipes or flutes with his community, and anyone is welcome to dance. One time, when the author of the study was at one of these events, there were two folks from the community who performed with extremely out-of-tune flutes, but it seemed like everyone was having fun. The author of the study, coming from a very different background from the West, was driven crazy by the out-of-tune flutes and tried to stand as far away from them as possible. He was shocked that none of the other players felt or gave any indication that anything was wrong, and no one discouraged their participation. Later, he had a conversation with another professional musician about how to tune, and even he said he cannot bring himself to point out that the flutes were out of tune. This is very different from the society I'm used to, where only the best are expected to perform, and music is often a way for the most talented people to showcase their talent. Since art is willing to grow to the human experience, isn't it better for music to be participatory? You should probably be more accepting of all skill levels taking part in art instead of just putting the best on a pedestal. On the flip side, I also think that there should be people pushing art to its boundaries, and of course, that can't be everyone. I just think, and my friend thinks too, that everyone should get a chance to participate in music, just like that community...and curve.",2,2
350,179,"Today I was able to meet up with a friend that I hadn't seen in over ten years. Our time goes back to when we worked together for quite a while. We ended up losing touch after they moved away to another state. I tried to keep in touch with them over social media but I just lost contact after awhile. 

In any case, I happened to be out shopping at the mall and happened to stumble across someone who looked somewhat familiar to me. I went a bit closer towards their direction and got a better look. I asked, ""Bobby, is that you?"" He responded with a yes and then immediately he remembered who I was. We embraced and gave out a big laugh. It was so funny seeing him after all this time. 

We began to talk a bit and do some catching up. I had found out about why he was back in in the area and what he had been up to for all this time. I found out that he was visiting his parents and that he was out with his family that day. I couldn't believe that we would be able to see each other in such a random way. 

We decided to meet up for lunch the next day and just talk a bit more about how life had gone up to this point. We really got a kick out of seeing the changes that have taken place in each of us.",2,2
351,1790,"I'm going to tell you about the time I moved when I was eight, maybe nine, possibly only seven. I think it was in elementary school, and that's what got me into reading and learning. I had just started school, maybe finishing first grade in the middle of second grade. We moved homes, still in the same city, but I didn't know any kids in the new neighborhood. My friends weren't there anymore. Eventually, I did make a few friends, but in the beginning, there wasn't much to do outside because I didn't know anyone. I was at home a lot. We happened to have a bunch of books at home, including random encyclopedia books, so I decided to start reading them. They were fun, and I liked learning about things around the world. Since it wasn't through school or forced on me, I thought it was fun. If I forgot stuff, it was okay. Unlike school where you had to remember everything or try. So, accumulating knowledge was fun, and I loved throwing it out randomly. I always obsessed over it and eventually started reading stories and fiction too. These days, I haven't been reading as much, but I still love learning things. It stuck with me and helped me in school. Later in higher classes, I would come across the same things I had seen in encyclopedias before, making school much easier. My teachers are always kind of surprised that I've read something in some random, obscure book. That feeling of just learning things for fun and satisfaction is something I want to keep with me.",2,2
352,1791,"So here's something I wrote about Doors, but it's really sort of a metaphor for irreversible things. Imagine you're in the room, the kind of room which you never really think of leaving, and there's a door, though, that troubles you in this otherwise perfect room. You don't know what's on the other side - it might be paradise, it might be hell, it might be nicer than your room, or it might be worse. Do you take the door? The door turns out to be just a doorway with one side visible, and it looks like paradise. Since you can always return and everything will be exactly as it was before you left, you can choose to take the door, which seems like an easy decision. If the paradise outside is an illusion, you can return and there's a safety net, which is nice. So you could choose to take the door; not much can go wrong. Now suppose the door was made of wood, and there's now a real tangible door that you can't peek through, but you can still walk back if you take the door. You might enter paradise or you might regret your choice. So you take the door. Out of ground this choice isn't much harder - life in the room is nearly perfect, and would be at risk being thrust into hell for a chance of something better. But in the end, you know you can always come back, so you take the door. Now suppose the door is made of glass, and you can see the other side which is paradise. There's a lock, however, so if you leave the door, you will never return, and all you have is the vision through the glass. It's scary because it's permanent, but you also don't need to leave immediately. You can stay in your perfect room for however long you want, and then take the door. Now, suppose the door is made of metal, you can't see through it, and it will lock so you can only choose to exit and never return. The stakes are much higher, because you don't know what's beyond the door and you can never return. But you still have the option of waiting for long, spending your entire life in your perfect room until you have nothing to lose, and then taking the door. But now imagine you have to do the whole thing again, with all these different doors, but you only have one night to decide whether you take the door at all. If you want to, it might be the best decision you ever make or the worst one. Maybe you never know what you missed. I can't decide whether I want to take the door in that one.",3,3
353,1792,"Blue, today, I attended the first lecture of one of my classes this semester, which is quite fun. The class is about J.R.R. Tolkien, the famous author of The Lord of the Rings, who was also a great scholar of medieval literature, languages, philology, and stuff. He had conversations with friends like C.S. Lewis, who, at least in the beginning, was an atheist and didn't believe in the value of things like God and metaphysics, but he later converted. Today, we read a part of a poem written by Tolkien, which wanted to explain why metaphysics are important because C.S. Lewis thought metaphysics were just beautifully crafted lies without any truth in them. Tolkien's response was to compose a long poem about why metaphysics are useful. One part that particularly caught my attention was the beginning, where Tolkien describes a fictional character called Miso Metis, who doesn't believe in the value of metaphysics. He says the person looks at natural objects like trees and just labels them ""trees"" and walks across the Earth as though everything is determined mathematically, with atoms moving as expected and every outcome being predictable, as if the world is just code regimented in a way where destined atoms are each moment's flame. It's like a very lifeless worldview, in contrast with a different one in which he believes in a God and has a belief that there's some purpose beyond our comprehension, and God who made everything in the world. These are not merely just objects that work according to mathematical principles, but more than that. I think this struck me because, like the professor mentioned, MIT students tend to have this worldview, viewing the world as deterministic and treating life as sort of an optimization problem to get the maximum outcome. I don't think all MIT students are like this, but a subset does think like this. I disagree with that worldview. I agree with Tolkien that life is not just an optimization problem and that part of life is experiencing imperfections and decisions. But maybe that's just me. I'm not sure.",2,2
354,18,"About a month ago I returned to doing something that I was very passionate about and loved to do. It had been about five years since I had last been a pool. 

Since I was about 8 years old I had been swimming competitively over the summer at my neighborhood pool, from there I swam for my high school team, and then around the same time I began swimming for a club team. Between morning practices before school and then practices after school as well as the occasional swim meets that took place throughout the week my schedule was booked. I would go to my club practices every Saturday meaning essentially I got one day off every week which was Sunday. 

When the season was up for high school swimming I would go on to continue swimming for my club and then during the summer I would do both club and swim for my neighborhood swim team. Swimming was my life. It was all I had known since I was 8 years old and when I was 18 I had to make the painful choice about whether or not I wanted to continue swimming in college. 

I ended up choosing having a social life over swimming to a lot of people's dismay. Towards the end of my high school career I was emotionally and physically drained and I felt like I just needed a break. So I went on to have a normal college life with no swimming involved. It was difficult. The guilt definitely took a toll on my subconscious. I would have dreams all the time about getting back into the pool and I wondered if I had made a mistake. 

I began to avoid pools at all costs and it wasn't until recently that I decided I was ready to get back into the water. A light that seemed to have dimmed inside of me was now brighter than ever and it just felt right and I've been doing it ever since.",3,3
355,1800,"Yeah, I've been reaching out to more people and seeing if I can talk to more people in this New York City and get to know more people around here. I had a dinner with a friend last week, which was really nice. It was really good to have common friends and then catch up. We had Korean food, which was really nice. And I think she is Chinese. I don't think she ever had Korean food, I don't know. It was very new for her, so it was really nice just to explore something new together. She's a master student, so she's still studying. That was interesting to hear what she's been doing and what? Yeah, I just graduated so I could see, I could see whatever she was going through, like how I was also going through the same things and how difficult it is to start studying again, and then be in this new space where you're supposed to perform so much, but then you're also trying to get somewhere. But it's also really confusing and scary. So I could empathize with that, I think. But then, yeah, it was interesting. I did feel like not heard in that whole conversation. It was very one way, she didn't ask a lot about me, which is fine. But it was like a network dinner, and not like ""Oh, friend"" kind of thing, which is also fine. I think not every person you meet is going to be your friend, but it was like a new thing to try, which was nice.",2,2
356,1805,"Hello. I was just going to say, ever since I was little, I enjoyed waking up and hearing birds singing. My mother knew every bird call and could identify every bird, tree, and flower indigenous to Virginia. I was always in awe of that. Since we've moved back here, I started doing ebird, which is an offshoot of the Ornithology Department at Cornell University. It's called ebird. It's basically trying to ascertain the number of migratory birds in a certain area at a certain time so they're able to go back for several years and look through to see what types of birds were coming through here, stayed here, and what is not so prevalent now. I am pleased to say, since doing it, I can recognize many calls. I can say, ""Oh, that's a Cardinal."" It's really fun. I have a crow that comes just about every day to eat peanuts. His name is Victor because of a vampire movie I saw once, and he looks real big and black. Anyway, it's just fascinating to me to watch them and to see all the colorful birds. Like I said, Cornell does a wonderful job. They have a great Ornithology Department. It's just something, excuse me, that I've always wanted to learn more about. Since I have started learning it, I've taken additional classes with the Ornithology Department and learned so much about identification. In my own yard, I have identified over 180 species and turned in over 5,000 daily sheets. I'm proud of that. It's given me a wonderful hobby. I just wanted to tell you about that. Thank you.",1,1
357,1806,"Okay. In other outings, in other sessions, rather, I have discussed that I didn't have a lot of friends my own age or in school because I was three years younger than my classmates and we weren't doing the same thing socially. Thank goodness there wasn't social media because I would have been in dire straits, but nonetheless, other than homework, it would have been great with all the internet and all that. But nonetheless, when I was growing up, it was true. I read most of the time and books were my friends. But at school, I didn't have a lot of close companions or acquaintances because they looked at me as someone rather odd. And in between being a bookworm, I was also very sick. I had lung disease since I was born, and so they weren't quite sure what category to put me in. So I didn't fit in any categories. So across the street from where my parents lived, a colonel and his wife moved in. Colonel from the Air Force. And they had traveled all over the world. And they brought with them a young girl they had adopted from Okinawa. And I want to tell you about her. Haysia Garrett was her name. And she was three years younger than my brother. She was a freshman when he was a senior in high school. And she was exotic and beautiful, a beautiful girl. And her parents, one thing, they dressed her very nicely, always looked put together and beautiful. And she befriended me. Her parents were very, very strict. They didn't allow her to socialize with the neighbors or any of the people around, much less date or, God forbid, a boy would come by. But anyway, I started going over to her house after school when she'd get home, and we just had the best time. She regaled me with stories about Okinawa and the foods that they would consume, which I was like, oh, wow, that's so exotic. And she told me this story: they were very poor. It was five girls, and their father, after World War II, he had been a profitable farmer. But after World War II, that was no longer viable. And so he would go out rummaging for stuff to sell and make money, he came across this big piece of metal. And he brought it back to the kitchen and he was trying to get scrap metal off of this big piece to sell for money for food and the like. And unbeknownst to him, it was an unexploded bomb of some sort. And by striking it with a hammer, it exploded, killing him instantly. The girls had various stages of injuries and stages of severity. Haysia, she had a mark on her arm with shrapnel in it on her forearm, looked almost like a vaccination used to look in your upper arm. And anyway, she told me about her sisters, and the only one I can remember is Hike Hume. But Haysia, she was just a wonderful friend to me, taught me so much about the world, and was kind and considerate to me, considering all that she had been through losing her family, moving to a strange country, learning English, and of course, the attitudes in the '60s. It was still ""dap"" that word was used and heard that frequently, and yet she managed to show kindness to a skinny little sickly kid. She didn't realize how much her kindness touched me and how it changed my whole trajectory in childhood, from being the outcast to feeling like I had a really special bond with someone and knowing that I could be a good friend to people and that I had something to offer them. She made me feel special. For that, I'll never forget Haysia and how beautiful she was and how she overcame so much. I loved her and I still do. Remember her quite fondly. She got married and we lost touch, but she's in my heart forever. Thank you.",3,3
358,1808,"Okay. Well, I told you about how I met my husband, right? I took my daughter to that concert in Atlanta. And anyway, I found out he was a metalhead, like heavy metal music - the lead guitarist and singer. And he just traveled all over the world and played. So, after we met, we started writing each other emails daily or we do direct messaging with hearts and all that. We talked for months from April until July, and I went to New York. He was still practicing well, rehearsing with his band, and we were working on material. But he was working as a session musician in New York. So he told me if I would come there and visit, ask me if I would come there and visit. So I went, and I decided to take an Amtrak because it's a 55-minute plane ride from Richmond to New York. So I said, ""I want to be able to look out the window and see the countryside."" But get there expediently, so I took the train. I was really nervous. It was like I didn't know what to expect because my children were, like, ""Oh, go and have a great time? Go, have a great time."" They were in college. They didn't care what I was doing. And one of my older sisters, she said, ""Hope, he's not an axe murderer."" And that pretty much sums up their relationship. Anyway, so I'm nervous and I get there, and I had to go to the bathroom really bad. So I went to the bathroom, and I was coming out, and he passed me. And I said, ""Rolo,"" and it was him. So anyway, what happened was he had gone to the station, and I wasn't there. He assumed I didn't come. And when I came out of the bathroom and was looking for him, I assumed he didn't come. So anyway, we met. He was gorgeous with that hair. And we proceeded to do all the touristy things because I hadn't been to New York in years. Because I'd been going to work for a European company, so I went to Europe a lot. Anyway. The request I had made was: it was a blue Moon, it was the 31st of July. And I asked that we dance on the moonlight of a studio where they were rehearsing. And at midnight. And that request was granted. And he just proceeded to tell me if I would move up and be with him, I could do whatever I wanted to. So to me, someone who had restrictions for so long on a set schedule and everything that I was to do for the day would be a laundry list, it sounded wonderful. Totally anathema to what I was doing because I was so controlled about everything. And so, we just had the best life in New York. We would take his rehearsal spaces in Bayonne, New Jersey, which is about 9 miles outside of Manhattan. And we would take the water taxi. And on my way to work every day, I would pass the Statue of Liberty, and it just felt I just felt really happy during that time. The people were a different story because in Virginia, everybody's ""Hi, how are you? La, la, la, la, la,"" really nice. Well, in Central Virginia, no, Northern Virginia is more rough, not rough but they're not as kind and gentle people, anyway. Well, that might be an oversimplification, I guess because there are so many more people and the traffic and all that, you get to be more uptight. So anyway, things that happened in New York was I remember the first time I peed. That day when I got there. I moved. This was in October, from July until October. I would go every week and visit him, fly or drive. One time. And that was the last time. Anyway, I kept coming to visit and things got really well. We just got on so well from the onset. So anyway, the first day I moved in, October 13. I don't remember the year anyway. He told me to call and order. He gave me a number of this great shop, he said, Italian place. Get a couple of salads. So I called, and the gentleman answered the phone and said, ""What do you want?"" And I hung up the phone immediately because I thought I'd bothered him and it was a place of business. He didn't mention that or anything, so I called back and ordered subsequently. But anyway, it was just such a melting pot of cultures and I loved it. I walked everywhere. I didn't have to drive. I hate driving. And it was just my daughter would come, and we'd walk down Broadway. And on Saturdays, we'd go to all the little food places and get something from all these different cultures. And we would just try different dishes, and we'd go home with all our purchases and have a feast. And then we'd go to the rehearsal space, and she loved my husband from the start. My son was more standoffish, but he didn't come visit us. But when we moved back here, after we lived in Florida, then it's not his father. So his father's dead, and he can't replace him. So I'm rambling. But anyway, I just wanted to tell you I moved up to New York, and it was like my eyes were wide open. And it was so nice to be exposed to that. Because so many people here, they are born and raised in a town, and they never leave it. I mean, they go on vacation and whatnot. But they never experience any different cultures or different life. And I just can't understand it. But anyway, we danced on them. I told you about his dancing. About. And we just had a great time in New York, and it's a wonderful city. The museums are great. The Met, The Guggenheim. It's just a wonderful place. You have to be careful, like in every big city. But it's definitely an eye-opener. Someone from a more provincial point of view. So even though I'd been there and all over the world living there, it was a whole different experience. And I had so much fun. So that's my story.",2,2
359,181,"An event that was memorable to me recently is getting a new kitty cat. She was a gift for my seven year old son from his father, he cleared it with me first whether he could get the cat as we already have two. I initially was going to say no, but then he told me that it was a Rag Doll kitty, and I had read a lot about how awesome that breed of cat is. The fact that it was a pure bred cat changed my mind as to whether we should get it. My first two cats are rescues, from a kill shelter and from a vet's office, I told myself I had saved two already and I can give this one a good home too. 

I told him yes, then we had to almost a month for her to be ready to come to our house. When my ex finally brought her over I had no idea how quickly I would fall in love with her. She's the cutest, fluffiest, little kitty ever, and her personality is so easy to like. She's sweet and cuddly, purrs as soon as you touch her or pick her up, and she looks so happy to be pet. 

She's also super playful, pick up a toy and she comes running and pounces on it, her favorite toys have feathers on them. She runs and jumps through the air so comically that you can't help but laugh at her antics. 

She's made a huge impact in my home, the other two kitties have been very accepting of her, after the first day hissings. I love my first two cats to pieces, but neither one of them is a lap kitty. New kitty loves to curl up on my lap and be pet. It makes me so happy to have a kitty that likes to snuggle and be close. 

I'm very happy that I now have three cats in my home, so is my son, as he likes to say he's a crazy cat boy.",3,3
360,1810,"Okay. I just wanted to talk about my mother, the coolest lady ever. We had like two families in my house. My mother had me very late in life. My sisters are 20 years older than me. My brother was eleven, so I was the youngest. When parents say they don't have a favorite, they always do, and you can't help it. It's human nature. I was my mother's favorite, and I'm sorry, my sisters really resent that. We just meshed, were the same. Anyway, she took good care of me when I was a child and sick all the time. She loved me unconditionally. When I got older and could drive, it was like we've got freedom. My father worked all the time as a chemical engineer, even renovating Victorian houses for my sister in Charlottesville on his vacation. My mother never got to do anything unless I took her. We'd make events out of the silliest things, like mock pina coladas at the car wash. We had wild times doing crazy things. We shared a love of hot, spicy foods. She was the best mom ever. She saved money, very frugal from the Depression. She was so much fun, we had the best time together. I could tell her anything, she would tell me anything. She died when I was in my early 40s, miss her every day. For the longest time, I would try to call her every day. She never got to meet my husband, who I met the same year she died. I feel like she sent him to me because I wouldn't get along so well without her. Gregory is outgoing, wonderful, total opposite, but we mesh perfectly. I think she sent him to me. I met him a month after she died. That was the story about my mother, Elsie, who always likened it to the cow, so I called her Elise. Gina and Elise had some thrilling little adventures here.",3,3
361,1811,"First off, it might sound rambling, but it's a means to tie it all up. We became tired of the same old routine in New York. Working, going to the studio, it became hectic with my four-hour commute. So, we decided to move down to Florida where my husband's mother and stepfather lived on a farm inland. They had ten acres with animals. We stayed with them and decided to get a place at the beach. The beach was only 35 to 40 minutes away and we would go there every Saturday and Sunday. The water was clear and we enjoyed the seafood joints there. We were happy, but I contracted a soil-based disease due to my inherent asthma. I had seizures and was in ICU for 45 days. My husband helped me with IVs at home. I would sleep on the sofa with our five rescue cats surrounding me. They seemed to be protecting me. One day, I felt someone rubbing my forehead like my mother used to when I was sick. It was a comforting presence that continued even after I found out an older lady had passed away in the house. My husband teased about the ghost and a glass panel on the stove broke as he said the ghost didn't like him. We moved the following fall because of the burden and strange occurrences. It was nice to come back to Virginia. Whether it was a ghost or just a feeling from my NDEs, it was a calming and reassuring presence in Florida. Thank you.",3,3
362,1813,"So, okay, I started this project talking about my brother and I'm going to end it that way. Okay, so my brother went through basic training at Fort Benning, then to Fort Polk in Louisiana, back to Fort Benning in Georgia, and then back to Fort Polk. He was doing well and was eventually promoted to Sergeant. He was always real fraternal and a natural leader. So anyway, he became a Sergeant and was leading his troops. From what I recall, it was a late fall almost Christmas time and it was cold and brisk. I remember walking home from school. I had the type of mother who every day when I got home, she would have something baked, like gingerbread. Oh, the house smelled heavenly. This one particular day, I come home and I open the front door expecting wonderful aromas but instead there was silence. The house was dark. I was calling for my mother and walked to my parents' bedroom. There she was, looking small, sitting on the edge of her bed by a window looking out. There was a letter next to her that had fallen to her side. I said, ""Mama."" She didn't move, so I picked up the letter and it was from the Department of the Army. My brother had stepped on a landmine and was being airlifted to Walter Reed Army Hospital in D.C., about 90 minutes away. So she was in shock and I had to comfort her. But I wanted to mention that he survived, if he had been 1 cm closer, he would have been blown to bits. The guy behind him got shrapnel which almost blew his knee off. He was never the same after that. But I loved my brother dearly. He subsequently passed, never the same once he came back from that war experience. He didn't mind shooting the enemy when they were firing at him, but he couldn't kill an old man in a village because he thought of our grandfather. He told me that story, I loved my brother.",3,3
363,1816,"Back in first grade, there was this kid who moved to our district, name was Zoe, and she was pretty headstrong in what she would do. Like she would do it fully, without any hesitation or concern about consequences. I remember one art project we were doing where we had to paint snowmen. We had to make the hat black, the nose orange, and everything else was to be white. Zoe accidentally spilled a drop of black onto the white of her snowman's body and turned it into a coat. I thought that was super cool, so I did that to mine as well. Eventually, the teacher kind of got mad at us and washed ours off so we could repaint it. I wasn't too grappy about it, but Zoe just didn't seem to care. In that moment, I learned that if you're going to do something, at least be fully confident in it and don't be too affected if the results aren't what you want or expect. You do something, own up to it and accept what happens as a result. I carry that on today. Now she's very successful, on a study abroad program that's super selective in Japan, doing exactly what she wanted to do from the beginning. No one's told her no or told her to do something else. She just keeps on going. I really admire that about her.",2,2
364,182,"About six months ago I entered a custody battle after my partner admitted to cheating, then subsequently ran off with our child. I had just started a new job, so I had to sell a majority of my belongings and dip into my savings to pay for representation. In the process, given I had to take time off from my new job, I wound up being let go even though I was told by my supervisor that it was okay for me to take time off from work so soon given the importance of the situation. 

I knew I wouldn't be able to keep up with my overly expensive rent, so I wound up breaking my lease early and living in an Airbnb for a month thanks to my savings. This gave me time to look for a new job and actual apartment to start over in. 

I wound up losing the custody battle in the process because I could no longer afford to pay my attorney. If it wasn't for the vast majority of online jobs available today and the fact that I didn't sell one of my laptop computers, I probably would've been out on the street considering everyone in my family has passed, and a majority of my close friends now live on the other side of or outside the country. 

Needless to say this has been an eye opening experiencing, and it just goes to show you that life is so unpredictable. Here I was comfortable in my career path only to have an unforeseeable event turn entire life upside down. I've always been a humble person, but when you go from eating at five-star restaurants daily, to eating free Dunkin' Donuts for a month straight it really makes you realize what's really important in life. 

All and all this experience has taught me a lot. Not to be jaded, but to really cherish and be thankful for the little things that you do have (like your health) instead of taking things like a hot shower or clean water for granted. 

I honestly don't know where this journey will take me next, but I'm honestly thankful that I at least have a roof over my head while I fight to get my life back to what it was. ""Just because you've found yourself in the gutter, that doesn't mean you have to stay there."" I once remember my grandfather saying those words to me when I was a child... And they've been my motivation throughout this entire experience. Both the good and the bad.",3,3
365,1820,"So I have some friends from a while ago, and we used to be really close together and we spend a lot of time. We would chat, we would hang out, we would go do stuff together. And there was a pandemic in the middle, so I wasn't really able to have a lot of contact with them. And the few that I did have contact with, it was mostly like around school, things like, ""Oh, what's the homework? Did you finish the homework? Do you have the answers to the homework?"" So I kind of left contact with a lot of them. And then right when everything was opening back up again, I chose to take a quarter off because there were no classes being offered, and I didn't want to spend money on classes that I wasn't really needing to take. By the time everything got open, people were fully back to doing stuff outside and meeting up, I had graduated and left. And then I moved to a different school because I started my PhD. I have some friends over there, but I've only known them for a short period of time, so I'm not super close with them. And then this summer, I came back home, hopefully hoping that I could meet up with the friend pool I had in undergrad and it just didn't happen, and it really hurt because I lost the opportunity to really make friends and maintain friends because of a pandemic that was outside of my control. By the time I was able to go back, I had to leave. Now I'm in this spot where I don't really have a lot of close people to talk with, so I'm kind of sitting by myself, and it's really lonely.",3,3
366,1822,"So, yeah, so maybe I don't know when I could say this story started, but I guess I could say it started nine years ago when I was in elementary school and middle school, I played the violin in an orchestra and then I decided to quit. I decided to play by myself and practice, but I just couldn't keep it up. This year, I decided I was going to do it when I was planning to move to Boston, make that one of my goals of things that I wanted to do when I got here, if it was available, and it was. I met up with a teacher, played something for her on the first day, and then told her I'd take two weeks to practice before starting up the lessons. The problem was I only practiced once. However, I'm meeting her day after tomorrow, so I practiced today as well. As I was practicing today, I remembered she was teaching me all these things about holding my bow. So, I just ended up walking around my room practicing that exercise she gave me. I kept thinking about how when I go in there, she'll either be impressed with my improvement or I'll have to admit I haven't practiced much. It's interesting when you have goals you are working towards, but it can be difficult to find the motivation to actively work towards them.",2,2
367,1823,"Yeah, let me think. A brief story, I guess, is today in my workplace they were holding a class. I wasn't planning to take the class or do anything. They were like, ""Oh, you should come. You should attend,"" just to have a presence. So I was like, ""Okay, I'll try to be there."" I go in, and then they actually had me participate in the class. I'm there, introducing myself, then they sorted me into a group for the activity. It was really interesting. In a different circumstance, the people in the class would be my peers because I graduated college last year. I could theoretically have gone into a master's and be doing a master's right now. They're master students, probably similar age to me, maybe some older. They were kind of looking to me for some sort of guidance or asking me questions. Some of the people seemed a little uncertain, then they would be like, ""Oh, is that right? Does that sound good?"" and kind of direct some of their questions and stuff to me. It was just very interesting to think about how sometimes, regardless of age, your life stage can be very different from someone. Your maturity or self-understanding kind of changes based on the environments that you're used to being in.",2,2
368,1825,"But yeah, so this is a story kind of about my own failings, I guess, and this kind of relates to something that we talked about before. You asked me how am I going to make sure that I get the advice and mentorship and stuff that I need. Actually, I have made progress on that because my work offers a mentorship program for people who are working. I met with someone today to find a mentor, and she said that she's going to try and get me connected with a buddy - like a buddy mentor who can kind of help me, but that's beside the point, that's not the story.

So basically, for the past five months or so, I have a particular friend that I haven't been talking to as much. I've been kind of not constantly worried about it, but I think about it sometimes and just, I don't know, just think about her. I wasn't sure because I thought she hadn't texted me, and I wasn't sure if I should text her if I should make that effort. Until last week, I actually texted her and I asked her like, ""Hey, have you forgotten about me?"" And she texted back immediately. She's like, ""What? I've been thinking about you. You never responded to my message or like my messages."" She sent me a screenshot, and I realized that she had tried to text me, but it went to the wrong number or went to my old number that I had before.

And so then that just led to me thinking a lot about how I want to deal with my anxiety around friendships because I feel like there are certain friendships that I really value and certain friends that I really value and I don't want to lose. I generally have pretty good instincts for things like that. But then, I will have that instinct, but then something else will happen that is kind of an issue or like a worry for me. I don't know exactly how to address it or how to fix it. So then I start to question whether or not my judgment actually was good, whether that person actually was a good friend. Or I'll say, ""We're a good friend for the time, but maybe not anymore."" And we'll just, I don't know, just kind of like spiral into worrying about it and being like, ""Okay, fine. The relationship is over. Whatever. I'll just have to let it go,"" but then I can never just let it go so I don't know why I even have that thought to begin with.

But yeah, so I talked to that friend today, and it was just so nice. There are some friends I talked to and I leave feeling kind of off or like, ""What was the point?"" or whatever. But this friend has never been the case, and I just feel like I really need to find a way of actually dealing with this problem that I have so that it won't just continue to get in the way of friendships that I really care about.",2,2
369,183,"My wife went to Germany this past spring for a study abroad program through her school. We live with another roommate who was here with me while my wife was away. One night I got a phone call from my landlord asking me if she can come over in the morning and perform some long needed maintenance on the bathroom. I'm usually a night person but I set my alarm for 8 AM, excited for our shower to finally be repaired. I always keep my phone on silent and when my alarm goes off at 8 AM I notice I received a text message in the middle of the night from my roommate. The text read: ""lol who's the drunk snoring guy?"" I thought nothing of the message, seeing as we live close to downtown in a city that has a huge homeless crisis. Many nights I'm awakened by people screaming as they walk past my house. I assumed a drunk guy fell asleep outside the house and she could hear him snoring from her room. 

Before the landlord arrives, I need to move my cat's kitty litter from the bathroom and bring it upstairs. I walk down the stairs and notice around the corner there are dirty shoes hanging off the couch like somebody is laying there. I peak around the corner and what do you know it's the snoring drunk guy. Panic flushes over me as I realize that's not somebody my roommate invited in. I look at the doors, both are locked. No windows are broken. I go through all these different scenarios in my mind about who the person could be. Maybe it's an old tenant who knows my wife and still has a key. Maybe it was the maintenance guy that'd be helping my landlord that morning and he got here too early and decided to take a nap. 

I walk back up the stairs and wake up my roommate telling her I have no idea who the drunk snoring guy is. She's just as startled as me, assuming the guy was a friend of mine, but also much braver as she grabs an empty wine bottle next to her in case she needs to bludgeon anybody. She gets up in the sleeping guy's face and wakes him up with questions about who he is and why he's here. He looks just as startled as the both of us. Apparently, he came in through the kitchen window in the middle of the night, drunk as hell, thinking it was his friend's(our back neighbor's) house. He apologizes profusely and is super sweet and tells us he did this before at another neighbor's house.",3,3
370,1839,"Yesterday, I heard that one boy told my daughter to prove that she had a $1 million bill, and if she couldn't, she had to pay $5. It isn't appropriate for that to happen at school. I raised my concern in an email to her teacher last night and met with her this morning. She assured me that she will talk with those kids and let me know what she finds out, mentioning there might have been a misunderstanding between the students. However, I heard about the incident yesterday from another parent whose child was at the scene with my daughter, so from my perspective, it happened like that. Anyway, I'll wait for the teacher's response.

Regarding the $1 million bill, it's fake money. Lena, my daughter, thinks it's real money given by a random, very generous person she got the bill from during Christmas on the street, so she believes it's real. This situation is a little complex because she doesn't want to admit it's a lie. She believes it is real, even though it's not. But she doesn't want to say she didn't have the bill because she does have it. Let's see. The most important thing is that school must be a safe place where children can learn with respect to each other, and no kids should take money from other students for any reason. I'm upset and worried, but I'm heartened to hear that my daughter's friends were there with her and supported her when she was too scared to take action, eventually reporting it to yard duty. I'm grateful she had such nice friends.",2,2
371,184,"Yesterday I got to go the the capital of my state. I was impressed by the things that I saw, yet still disappointed. It was interesting to see the place we play baseball and some of the famous architecture that we have. I have also struggled with ageism in the work place and got a really good glimpse of it yesterday which was so disappointing. 

We were outside walking around at noon when all the office workers come out for lunch. The area we were in only had 1 or 2 people out of hundreds that were above the age of 30. I could not believe it. There were people everywhere and yet they were so young. This is not fair at all. We have worked just as hard to get our education and work experience, yet we are being pushed out of working for being older workers. 40's is now considered an older worker!. 

Anyway, it was nice to get away for a while and spend some time with a friend. We had to wait 3 hours. So we had plenty of time to see the sites and experience out state capital fully. I was impressed by how big everything is in the big city. I saw magazine covers, people working out right in the middle of the area. Scooters. Rentable bikes. Food everywhere.",2,2
372,1840,"""Yeah. So, I was playing tennis with my friend this weekend, she just had a baby, like a month ago, which is insane,"" she shared. ""She's super funny,"" she added, recounting the story of her friend getting to the hospital with her husband. ""Oh, man, it was just so funny."" ""But I can't believe that it's only been a month and she's playing tennis,"" she mused. ""I thought that was pretty impressive that she's able to get back."" ""Her and both of her husband are our friends,"" she continued, ""they're both pretty funny."" ""So, it's very interesting to see them both trying to get out and play tennis as much as possible, and then they have to switch off watching their baby,"" she chuckled. ""Oh, man."" ""But she was telling me about how she's a lot more chill now because she has this kid,"" she continued, ""mentally, she has changed her perspective,"" she added. ""I'm definitely have a different mental state now,"" she quoted her friend, ""which I guess makes sense."" ""It's pretty cool to have somebody finally that's had kids so you can understand what's going on,"" she reflected. ""Because up until now, I never had any friends that had kids,"" she admitted. ""And I haven't really been around babies."" ""It's going to be a funny little kid,"" she predicted, ""really smart parents."" ""So, it'd be kind of cool to be around.""",1,1
373,1841,"Well, like I said, we're watching my grandparents' dog and it just reminded me of when I had my dog when I was in 8th grade. I had him for two years, he was a little pug, very cute. My mom got him for free from one of her students who bred the dogs. We got Zazu because we had Simba, my other dog, so we kept with the Lion King theme. He was very hyper, but he was inbred which we didn't know. Zazu had a condition where he had a lot of air pockets around his heart and in his stomach, and it was very uncomfortable for him. He always tried to eat something to make himself feel better. He was always running around really fast, just a little uncomfortable, but he was my dog. He was so cute and he loved me and he was very smart. But it just reminded me of whenever we had to let him go. I was coming back from a baseball game and started getting panicked because I couldn't find him, he liked to hang out in my grandparents' closet. I called his name for like three or four minutes, and finally I heard his dog tags rattle, his collar. He was trying the entire time to get up, and I felt so bad because I couldn't find him and he was trying to get up. Finally, he did, and he was so weak. Very sad. But he was a good dog, a very good dog.",3,3
374,1842,"Well, I'm really excited because Thursday, I'm leaving to go on vacation for Portugal. But I just picked up a new job right before I left, and my regular work picked up a lot more than I'm used to as well, so it's been a little bit stressful trying to keep up with both. But one is like super fulfilling and really exciting, but it doesn't pay a lot. And then the other one is up and down with good and lots of things to do, and then at times, nothing. But there's really not a whole lot of career growth there or opportunities for growth. It's just kind of a lot of hustling, so I'm just trying to work into being able to do both. But I'm definitely working a little more. And so what I'm trying to do is tell myself that I need to take a break whenever I go to Portugal. Although I'm like super excited about this new job and really want to dive into it, it's pretty cool. It's like a lot of 3D modeling for coastline that then hurricane modelers and physicists can take their data and actually apply it to a 3D model. So I'm really excited about it. Most people there are really nice. I think the engineers are a little-- there's a couple that are a little like. They're a little not sure about me because I think a lot of times people think that design and art is trivial, when in actuality, it's just as cognitive and just as helpful. And just like I respect their profession, it would be nice if they would respect mine and see the value that I could bring to the table. I mean, it's kind of funny. A lot of their visualizations are just like so lost without their words, and I don't think they realize that they could create a better image that is more communicative to audiences that aren't familiar with statistics and modeling, and natural language processing. And this tiny difference that looks really tiny - it's like maybe you're using the wrong visualization, but anyways, I don't know, I'm really excited about my job, but it's also definitely requiring me to be a little more organized. Which is good. I think it's a good challenge for me. I tend to be all over the place and hopefully this will help give me some structure because I have more things to do. So I'll be a little more responsive to my time, or careful with my time, and actually plan it out instead of wasting it.",2,2
375,1843,"Yeah, so it was my friend's birthday this weekend and it was very fascinating. I have a friend who was my sister's best friend in high school, and she has three siblings, and they're all interesting. But I met her older brother, whom I'd known for a year now, and he was like way older than me, like seven years. I went out with them last weekend, and it ended up in this really weird situation where he's like a 40-year-old guy who can't handle his emotions, and somehow I ended up being a little bit of a counselor to him and mediating him and his sister's fight. This past weekend, his little brother, whom I was friends with, was in town for my friend's birthday, and it was just interesting because they were talking about me and I was a little uncomfortable about that. They both need a lot of therapy, I think, and need to just get a handle on their own emotions and boundaries. They apparently were trying to get my number, and I made a joke that I'm going to have to start charging him for asking advice on things. But it's just a little strange and I thought I was kind of flattered about the older brother being interested in talking to me, I guess, and saying nice things. At the end of the night, his little brother that I was friends with kind of brought it back into reality that I was like, ""Oh no, this is how these brothers act. There is no exception. This guy's probably being nice because I was being nice to him."" It was just very strange, yeah. I don't know, it made me uncomfortable.",2,2
376,1844,"So, yesterday was a bold and interesting, and somewhat intense day for me as I have been working on getting out of chronic isolation due to my complex trauma (Complex PTSD). I attended two events yesterday, one in person and the other online over Zoom. The in-person event was an art meet up group that I had attended once before, and yesterday was the second time I went. There were more people than last time and we were sort of packed which made me anxious due to my social phobia. However, I was able to ground myself and enjoy the event doing art with other artists. The second event was a Zoom call with a pagan spirituality class where I shared stories about my own spirituality and overall enjoyed it. Despite my insecurities, I felt like I contributed to the discussion and the organizer was appreciative. This level of social participation felt more intense than anything I've experienced since the pandemic and even back in college. The feeling I had at the end of the day was weird and unlike any burnout or fatigue from social interactions I had experienced before. It felt like overstimulation and was quite new and intense, which made it hard for me to sit still. I stayed up late at night unable to sleep, worrying that this feeling might discourage me from future social interactions. However, I am proud of myself for taking steps to battle isolation and heal from past trauma.",3,3
377,1845,"Today, I got a lot of compliments. I got back home just now, took a back to my apartment, and there's like a giant mirror in front of the elevators. I entered the apartment building, walked to the mirror, and saw there's a white chair facing the mirror. I thought it might be a property of the apartment and someone might put it there for a purpose. I just went to the chair, put my bag on there, and posted and took a picture of myself. As I was doing that, a person walked out from behind my picture and then murmured something I don't quite remember what exactly. I think he said, ""Hi"" or something. Then, I took my bag off the chair and the man went and grabbed the chair and I said thank you to him. At first, I thought maybe he might be like using the chair before and now he's returning the chair to its original location. I was confused for a few seconds. Then, I realized, ""Oh, that chair could be his. He might be moving in or moving out."" I was using the chair to pose like someone else's chair. I feel quite embarrassed. And I think it's funny at the same time.",2,2
378,1846,"Yesterday evening, I went to dinner with a friend who I last connected with a few months ago, Shuzian. We got to know each other through a common friend of ours. Shuzian helped me take care of my cat when I was on a gap year and not in the US, which was super nice of her. We've only met each other three times in total, so we don't know each other that well. In the past week, I have been feeling lonely and thinking about who I could reach out to. Shuzian came to mind, so I asked her to hang out, grab dinner, and go to her home to see her cat. It went better than expected, even though she unexpectedly brought her husband to dinner. Normally, I would feel socially anxious if someone I don't know showed up abruptly, but somehow, I was able to remain relatively calm. There were moments of awkwardness and not knowing what to say, but overall, the conversation went quite well. Shuzian even suggested hanging out again, which is a nice change for me because in past friendships, I've been the one who initiates events. After I told Shuzian that my friends were busy, she said she would be super happy to meet up again and play some board games. She even suggested bringing her friends over, which was super nice. In many of my recent friendships, there hasn't been a suggestion of continuing the relationship. It's nice that Shuzian suggested it, and I feel hopeful that a continuous relationship can develop between us.",2,2
379,185,"Recently, I was the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding. This was a very important day. I had never been in a wedding, let alone the Maid of Honor. I had a lot of responsibilities and was very nervous about walking down the aisle. I know that everyone is looking at the bride but I was still anxious about having eyes on me even for a few seconds. 

We started our day early in the morning with coffee and hair and makeup. We got our hair and makeup done by professionals and it felt very special. My best friend and I chatted about how today was going to be life-changing. I was super excited for her and her husband-to-be. 

The time came for the ceremony and I walked down the aisle before my best friend. I watched her walk down and had to hold back tears and ugly crying. I took her bouquet when she took the hand of her soon to be future husband. I listened to their vows and I remember how happy they both were. 

The time came to exchange rings and say ""I do."" I handed her her new husband's wedding band and it was a very special moment for all of us. It was the most beautiful wedding I have ever been to.",2,2
380,1851,"I thought about this storage day because I'm making our meal plan for next week so that we can get organized and do grocery shopping. Meal planning and things like that have just become more of like a chore to me. When I was little, growing up, we didn't have cable, just basic cable that you get for free. PBS was one of those channels. I started watching Julia Child's Cooking Show on PBS when I was like eight or nine years old. I would watch it every chance I could get when it came on, that and Bob Ross, Painting Happy Little Trees. I was always fascinated by the recipes she made. They looked so good and different. So I started cooking for my family when I was about twelve years old. I never made anything super fancy like Julia Child's stuff, but I always felt like Julia Child when I was cooking. After school, I graduated and went to a traditional college. I ended up getting my degree in business. It wasn't until after I graduated, or was about to graduate, that I realized you can go to culinary school. There are many other options out there. I applied for a culinary institute and got in, but the tuition was really high. I had student loans from my traditional college and going into more debt was scary to me. Fast forward years later, now I have two kids. I still enjoy cooking, but it's more of like a chore now because we've got to cook meals for the kids. My oldest daughter was helping me one day and I told her I almost went to culinary school. She asked, ""How come you didn't go?"" I explained about money. She said, ""But it's never too late, you can always go now."" She's right, I could go now, but my responsibilities are different now. What a great attitude to have from the perspective of a seven year old. It made me proud and reflect. Even though I didn't go to culinary school, I enjoy cooking with my kids and teaching them. I hope they find a love for the things I enjoy as well.",2,2
381,1853,"Okay, so I wanted to talk about the last two weeks. It's been really busy at work and I'm in a very interesting work situation right now. I've had the opportunity to step away from my normal job to do a fellowship program, which is really cool. I started this fellowship program back in April and it was supposed to be five months. When my five months came to an end, I approached the team about staying a little bit longer to provide some continuity. I got approval to stay for another cohort of this fellowship program, which is really exciting. I have a new coworker and we're supposed to be working together to accomplish all these tasks we've been given. Lately, I've been feeling a little overwhelmed because there's a lot going on and I'm frustrated that this other person isn't helping out as much as they should. I feel like they just lean on me to drive the train, even though we're teammates. We should be doing things together, not just relying on me for approval. So I've been really frustrated and overwhelmed, it's getting me down. I did take some time off, so I'll be off in the next three days, which will be nice to just take a break and clear my head. But I'm just kind of bummed out because of it.",3,3
382,1854,"But I guess I just wanted to think through something, I feel like I'm at a weird spot in my life. I think 23 was such a weird year for me, a lot of character growth. I never liked the number 23, always associate it with a weird vibe. Since the pandemic started, it felt like a lot of chaos, a lot of reshifting of priorities. From September 2022 to this year, last year was just a lot of sadness. I got COVID, and then I got sick so often. The last half of being 23 was so much better, solo traveled that forced me to do things on my own. Now I'm job hunting, realizing the limitations of not driving. For my career, I also have hard feelings on how important it is to focus on your career because I kind of don't care. But then I kind of need to feel secure. With my birthday coming up, it makes me wonder what the next year will be like. I feel like I'm in a better place to make decisions for myself. I know I have my friends and family to support me, which makes it better. So I think I'm being set up for a better experience for turning 24. Definitely 23 was a year full of chaos, growth, and reprioritization of my life. So maybe 24 will be better.",3,3
383,1855,"I wanted your advice about the thing I shared in the session. I guess I just feel weird about the whole situation. I told you where I went to my friend's birthday party dinner thing and I'm kind of part of the family, but kind of not. The brother is part of the family, but out of touch with what's been happening. It makes me feel weird because I know what's been like. The stories the brother didn't hear about or know, I had already heard or was familiar with. So it felt weird to be in this insider knowledge. Dang. I think I just feel weird about today and wanted to talk it out because I don't know how to process. It just felt awkward, the whole interaction. I don't know how awkward anyone else felt, but it felt weird that the celebration wasn't really just about her, but more about her brother. The other weird part was that the brother's fiance didn't remember me. I had red hair, but pretty much the same face. I was like, Girl, how do you not remember me? We met multiple times. It was awkward. I think today's close family event was more awkward for me, because I don't know my place. It's just weird.",3,3
384,1856,"Okay, so I'm in between a couple of stories to talk about. But I guess the one that's on top of my mind right now is related to birthdays. So, yesterday, I got processing feelings or rethinking things. For my birthday, my friend named Michelle, we've been friends since we were like twelve or 13. We had an interesting friendship development. We've been friends for a long time. Usually, my friends don't really get me anything for my birthday, unless it's like a birthday party, but even then not all the time. That's mostly because we all kind of grew up poor, and we're still kind of poor. So, I guess I just wanted to think through how as we get older and get access to more money, how does that change the way we spend and relate to each other. So, that's what's been on top of my mind because when I think about gifts or presents my friends have given me, it's always been something small, like a card or if they made something for me. We went out to eat someplace really cheap because we all really did not grow up with money, like low income. I've always been hesitant with gifts. Like gifts are not one of my love languages. I feel like because it's always been so hard with money growing up, it's hard for me to be comfortable spending a lot of money on someone or at least someone without them needing it. It's hard for me to give gifts that are valued a lot because I never really grew up with much. I feel weird when people give me gifts a lot of the time. I like the idea of receiving things. But when they're expensive, I'm kind of like, oh my God, why do they spend this much on me? My version of expensive is different than other people's version of expensive because I grew up poor. So, basically, my friend Michelle, we've been friends for a long time. We both grew up poor and now she has a higher-paying job and treats me out. I'm surprised and thankful. I'm also wondering what would my expectations of presence be if I hadn't grown up low income. I see that she's making more money and willing to treat me out. It makes me wonder how would I be thriving if I wasn't in survival mode. That's been on my mind. When I was making good money, I would treat people out, mostly at diners where everyone's meal is under $10. Or I would buy random things, mostly food related. I see the ways that I gave back and it's kind of nice to be on the receiving end. Now my friend is increasing in economic status, and she's also giving back. So, yeah, that's been on my mind. When I get another full-time job that pays me more than minimum wage, I wonder how I am also willing to give back to my friends and family. So, yeah, that's my story.",2,2
385,1857,"Okay, I had a dream recently about Salem, Massachusetts, because I don't know why it's the top of my head, but I did travel there one weekend when I was still in college and it took like 2 hours and a half by train, but commuter rail. So we had to swap and I made it to Salem, Massachusetts, which I've always wanted to go. I guess I've just been thinking about how much of a tourist trap it actually is. It's definitely not a place I want to visit anytime soon unless I was going with someone who's never been. I had a dream that reminded me of that experience and so I want to talk about haunted houses and horror, like horror, yeah, I guess. Now that Halloween is approaching us. So my sister, one of my sisters, really likes Halloween. And I was always kind of ambivalent to it, but I started thinking about all the times I accidentally got into a haunted house. The first time ever was in Salem, Massachusetts. So my friend and I decided to do a day trip and we were like, okay, we're going to go. I bought tickets to a museum, okay. I bought like tickets to the wax museum. And then I bought tickets to this haunted house, but actually I had no idea. I don't like haunted houses. I don't like being purposely scared. I feel like the world is scary enough. Why would I enact that on myself? So I try to avoid horror things. Then two years later, I bought tickets again to a haunted house by accident. Yeah. Well, actually later that year, my house floor at Wealthy became a haunted house. So if I wanted to get through my room, I had to go through the haunted house. And I was like, once I get in, I'm not coming out. So I had to walk through. Part of me wanted to do it, but this other part of me didn't. So this is the second time I accidentally walked into a haunted house. And it wasn't even that scary. They were on like a low budget for horror and it was just the fact that I knew they were trying to scare me freaked me out enough. Like I knew it was supposed to be scary and I was like, no, I'm out. I arrived in Switzerland and this person barely knew, I was like, sure, I'll travel with you. She's actually a good friend of mine now, but at the time I was just like, I don't know you, but we'll be travel buddies. And we worked out really well, travel buddies. She really wanted to go to London and I really wanted to go to Italy. So I was like, I'll go with you to London if you come with me to Italy. So then London was kind of our part to plan out because she really wanted to go and she was familiar with London and really liked the area. So as part of that, she was like, I really wanted to go to I think it was the Tower of Terrors, the London Bridge. The tombs, I think it was London Tombs. So it's basically like a part of the bridge where it's literally under an overpass of a bridge. And you go in and it's like a whole maze of horror. So they had like a doll house. They had a surgeon room. They had something with the pig at the end that freaked me out. So I was like, okay, I can do it. I'm brave. I got this. So then I was like, I just knew, don't be in the front, don't be at the end. So I tried my best to always be in the middle. And sometimes we got to break up our group and I was like, no, I'll do what it takes to shove my way so I am not at the end. And so I had my friend, literally the common denominator in all these stories, is like closing my eyes and running or like hiding behind someone. I wonder if that's a metaphor for my life, but at least for The London Tombs. Yeah, it felt like torture. Like I got to a point where I was like, I don't think I can do this any longer. I paid like £30 so I don't even know how much that was. But it was like £33, $35. And I was like, I have to stick it out because once I buy something, I'm like, I have to pull it through like already invested money in it. And I was hiding behind my friend a lot of the time and I was definitely closing my eyes all the time, but towards the end, once we got to the pig part, it was like a meat slaughterhouse and they had things hanging from the wall, they had blood everywhere. That and the doll room, I was just like, I need to leave. Like I'm out. I was barely holding it together. I really wanted to escape. I was already looking for emergency exits. I was like, I don't think I can do this any longer. Someone needs to pull the plug and it's going to be me. But right when I was at my end, at my wit's end and I was like, I can't do this any longer, I heard too, there's Swift music in the background. And I'm not much of a swifty, but I heard Taylor's up. And I was like, somewhere out there, there's an end to this tunnel. And on the other side, there's happy drunk people singing Taylor Swift. So then I was just like, I just had to keep closing my eyes and running through the tunnel, waiting for the swifty music to get louder and then finally we burst through the door and it opened up to a bar where everyone was screaming, like a Taylor Swift song. I don't remember what song it was. I just remember thinking, I am free. I can escape this and I don't have to be as scared anymore. So after that, I told my friend, I was like, Girl, we can't do this ever again. I was like, I'm done with horror stuff. Please let it be a chill rest of the evening. And I don't think it actually was because we ended up having, like, a problem with our flight. But at least I wasn't running away in fear with something chasing after me oinking. So those were three times accidentally walked into the haunted houses and decided to stick it through.",3,3
386,1858,"Okay, so I've been thinking about this for a day or so and just kind of trying to process my feelings around it or my new thoughts. My sister and I have been watching this K-drama, a Korean drama that I've already seen three times - in 2019, 2020, and now. My sister had never seen a K-drama before because she associates them with love, but this one was different. The main character, Jiho, described herself as slow and indecisive, which resonated with me. She was in her 30s and had never dated, which I could relate to. Watching her decisions unfold, I saw similarities in the ways we both chose paths and then suddenly changed directions. My sister even pointed out how I would react similarly to Jiho’s choices. I've always been told I'm made for something great, excelling academically and pursuing a prestigious university, only to quit my toxic job and travel. Now, I work at a bakery, rebuilding my skills for the future. Seeing Jiho make questionable decisions mirrors my own journey, and I find myself frustrated with where I am in life. It's interesting to see a character reflected on screen that's me and feel frustrated with them, even though I relate to their choices. It makes me question my own decisions and what I'm doing with my life.",2,2
387,186,"I wanted to discuss my nephew's graduation from high school. He graduated from high school in June of 2019 and I was so proud because he is going to Princeton for college. He worked hard and was able to make it there through a combination of decent grades, a very good score on the SAT as well as working part-time for his father's business. He took the SATs twice. The first time he didn't do so well and scored a 1250. However the second time, he made a conscious effort to work on the weaknesses that he remembered and improved his score to a 1400. He is also an intern for his father's company, which is in the real estate business. He did the various odd jobs there where he cleaned up, made sure the pantry and other areas were well stocked and helped to input data into the company's systems. 

Part of the money that he saved was used to start up an IRA account. I work as a financial analyst and tried to show him what would happen if he used the power of compounding interest and how large he could grow his nest egg if he had 40+ years to invest. He ended up opening the account and buying 25 shares of Disney. 

When he graduated, we first went to a nice dinner at our local favorite Italian restaurant where he had his favorite meal, lasagna with a side of creamed spinach. After that we went to a movie. After that we went back home where we relaxed, played some board games and shared stories about the time that we went to college. It was, all in all, a very fun night.",2,2
388,1860,"All right, so I want to talk about when my friend visited. She was only here for a brief time, maybe two days, technically. It was my first time hosting a friend, and it was nice to be able to return the favor as I've had good experiences staying at other people's homes. My friend visited me because I was doing a master's program in Phoenix, and she lives in Boston. She came for class, so we only had about a day and a half to hang out. We ate a lot of good food, like street corn, mangoes, and carne asada fries. My goal was to show her unique Southwest food. She mentioned she only eats once a day, so I didn't know that and we ate a lot. We went out for drinks and visited murals in Phoenix. We also walked around the State Capitol and saw a movie being filmed about the founding of Arizona. It was cool to eat, take photos, and spend time with my friend in that way. I really like playing tour guide and sharing random facts about where I live. My friend enjoyed her visit and my family liked her too. She's welcome to come back anytime. That's what I did this weekend.",1,1
389,1869,"""Yeah, in this process of getting pulled into a different project, I started in a track with a lot of different people who I did not know about before, which are within my organization, per se,"" I shared. ""One of the questions, it was pretty interesting to meet that person and contrast that with somebody who has been in the company for a long time,"" I continued. This new person, fairly new, he's trying to get himself settled and everything,"" I observed. ""It was nice for him, it was nice for us to talk,"" I added. And then I was able to help him on a couple of things that he was trying to figure out on his own. I have had experience with people who have been in my company for a really long time, and then working with them was quite different than working with someone who's completely new and collaborating with that person on that project,"" I reflected. ""So it was refreshing for me to look at how things can be pretty challenging for somebody who has joined something for the first time and taking up a new project,"" I concluded. ""So it was pretty interesting,"" I smiled.",2,2
390,187,"My Wife and I just arrived in Portland, Oregon. It is our first time to the city. The airport was older, but still OK, we did not spend much time there. We took a lyft to our hotel, and the driver informed us about a protest that was scheduled for that day. We were unaware of that protest. The driver told us that the proud boys, anti-fa, and the pride rally were all meeting to protest one another. 

The protests started peaceful, until the protesters began to interact. At the time, the proud boy group was mostly tame, which is out of character for the group. Surprisingly, anti-fa began attacking the pride rally. I was not expecting this, i thought both groups were aligned on the same side of the political spectrum. Anti-fa attacked pride members with ""concrete milkshakes"" which were milkshakes make with quick dry concrete. 

This attack happened a block from our hotel. A few hours into the ""protest"" homeland security dressed in full tactical gear were dispatched and took control of the square where the protests were happening. This was a shock to my wife and I. We were not expecting this when we arrived to Portland! Turns out, this is fairly common in Portland. 

The hotel only told us to avoid the protests, and they did not seem surprised by the officers in tactical gear. One of the most odd experiences we had was the next morning. We ate breakfast at a food truck that was parked in the square where the protests happened. We ate breakfast in a peaceful square on a beautiful morning, like nothing had happened just a few hours before. 

It was truly an interesting start to our trip and something i will not soon forget.",2,2
391,1872,"After a long time, I opened up my Xbox and downloaded the latest game that they had, always feeling that console gaming is pretty cool stuff to do as I used to play a lot of games. But lately, when I moved to the US to complete my Masters and also get into a job, I haven't been playing a lot of console games, primarily because I felt that I've grown out of playing games, especially the UI and the complexities in each game. ""How do we go about playing them?"" I wondered. ""Oh my God, this is so complicated to understand. How do I just go ahead and play a game or race a car or whatever?""

So yesterday, on a holiday or Sunday, I went ahead, opened my Xbox, downloaded the latest game, and powered through the UI, which is a little complicated, but I powered through to play a couple of games and I got really engaged. I felt very good yesterday after doing all that task and just playing the game after a long time, playing for about 5 hours.

Playing made me realize how my parents felt or how somebody feels when they are not in touch with a particular aspect of technology.",2,2
392,1884,"I'm not sure it's captivating, but I will tell you what I've been thinking about because I listen to a podcast called Hidden Brain, and it's wonderful. The topic of the last piece that I listened to was happiness and what is happiness and who is happy. Does money make you happy? Does fame make you happy? Does beauty make you happy? The answer, according to this person, is none of the above. One of the things is to shift from complaining to doing exactly the opposite of complaining. I was unsure what he was going to say was the opposite of complaining, but he said savoring. And I thought, yes, that's the perfect word. How do you savor? And why do you savor? You savor something that made you happy. The best way to extend that happiness, I think, is to remember it. He has three ways to savor, and all those ways support memory of the event. His idea is to anticipate it. So let's say we're going to the beach. Oh, what will it be like? I wonder if the water will be cold and the sand will be white? Or will it be pink? Will we find shells? Can we build a castle? Step two is to go and experience the beach and say, ""Hey. This water is way colder than we thought, but it's still refreshing and the sand is way browner than we thought. But, boy, it really hangs together when you try to build a castle."" And you bring good food. Maybe you didn't expect you met somebody fun and so on. The third step is to remember that and go over it with other people. So that's a real good, concrete way to approach what is happiness. That's a God-given right in this country. We say the pursuit of happiness. It's not an easy thing to do. Like listening and hearing, you can hear people talk. But listening is the active endeavor of trying to make sense of what they say. Pursuing happiness is key. Of course, happiness- in order to feel true happiness, it is said, although I'm not a fan of pain or sadness, it is part of life. You need to deal with those things as bumps in the road or turns on the journey. Happiness is a good thing to think about and would be helpful to talk to kids about so that their expectations aren't that from here on in, everything is going to be perfect. Life is a series of problems. In school, we teach you how to solve problems. We're teaching you how to jump in there and make your life better and hopefully other people. That's my Sunday morning thought.",2,2
393,1888,"Yeah, so like I've said before, I've been kind of on a job search for the last year. Last week, I had a brilliant idea to reach out to somebody I had interviewed maybe a year and a half ago, because I knew the background he was coming from was a company I wanted to work at. We had ended up chatting when I gave him a tour of my current company, and we hit it off. Since then, we've reached out to each other a couple of times to chat and help each other. I asked him for help the other day to see if he had any connections at the place I was looking for. He immediately responded and connected me to the hiring manager at the company, who agreed to set up a meeting for the next week. It was amazing. What freaked me out, though, was that a few minutes after that conversation, I got a message from my boss asking if I knew this guy. My boss shared a message from the guy saying he wasn't treated well during the interview process at my current place of work. My stomach dropped. Did this guy turn me in? We're looking for a new job. It turned out he didn't do that, and he would never do that. But it was kind of scary for a second.",2,2
394,189,"A few months ago I was at Petco. I saw a woman trying to wrangle a cat inside one of the cat cages while she was cleaning it, so I stopped to offer to help. I held the cat while she was cleaning the cage and he started purring, rubbing his head on my chin, and practically went to sleep in my arms. I got to talking about the cat with the woman, learning a bit of his tumultuous history. There was no way this cat would have all the behavioral problems that the sheet said he did. I chatted for almost an hour and, by the end, I had all but adopted the cat. 

I took him home with me that day, borrowing a carrier from the rescue group to transport him. Although the first few weeks were rough, he integrated well with my other cats. The other young cat hid from him for quite some time, spending almost entire days under the couch and staring at me with eyes that said ""Who this guy in my space?"" Eventually she snuck out to sniff him before darting away and, one day, I woke up to find them both on the bed. Opposite corners, to be sure, but together on the bed! 

It was a great relief to see everyone be happy. I named him Kismet for the twist of fate that brought him to me. He's been an amazing cat and even a surrogate dad for some kittens I agreed to foster. He's very fond of kittens, letting them crawl all over him and cleaning their ears at every opportunity. 

I'm really glad I met Kismet and I'm even gladder that he'll be a part of my life going forward.",3,3
395,1894,"Kind of think of what would be a good story, got a couple in my head, maybe at work today. I don't know, I've been feeling like I just have been given enough to do lately, which is probably one of the reasons I'm looking for another job. They pay me very well, and I don't have to work all that much, so I don't really know why I'm complaining. But, I feel like I need more to do just to feel satisfied. Just today, I had more to do than usual lately. Sometimes it's a lot of stuff today, sometimes it's not that much. More lately it's been not that much. But today, what did I do today? Had like a meeting early in the morning, kind of throughout the day. I was working on a piece of software that I'm trying to build, just kind of in the background, which is like a kiosk browser - it's kind of hard to explain. Also was working on a project in Singapore that we had to leave before finishing installing it. I was working with one of the junior credit technologists on the team since they were the one who put it together, and I'm just kind of the oversight on it, but I need to make sure it all works. So we were debugging it together a couple of times throughout the day.",2,2
396,1895,"Yeah, when my wife and I went out on a date tonight, we went shopping and found a toy store, which was fun. I think I've shared before we're going to have a baby soon. And she was at a toy store. And she was like, you know what? Why don't you get her like a stuffed animal? And I was like, okay, that's a good idea. So we found one, I found one. She said it would be good for me to pick it out, so I found a dark brown stuffed bear that was really cute, seemed good quality and very soft. Then my wife had the good idea to get a second identical one, just in case, you know, whatever gets lost or damaged, or even, I don't know, 20 years from now, we want to pull it out and be like, ""hey, look how this thing has aged over time compared to the original one."" So we got the lady at the front desk to go look for the second bear because they didn't have two of them out at once, and luckily they had one and we ended up buying both. So that should be really nice when one of them becomes.",2,2
397,1896,"Hello, hi. Jibo, thinking about wildlife. This is a quick story about the time I was a boy, about eight or nine years old, and I took a family trip to Florida, where they have lots of different wildlife, including lizards. They interested me a great deal, being from New England, where I wasn't used to seeing lizards crawling around. My father and I set up a jar to catch a lizard, which we left out overnight. We were successful and caught a lizard that I was excited to bring home as a pet. However, the family member we were staying with released it when they saw it in the jar. As a young man, I was sad and upset that the lizard I caught was back in the wild. I felt hurt and a little mad. As I got older, I understood that the older relative had done a very kind thing by letting the lizard go. They never explained to me at the time, but I realized they had done a kind thing. The lizard didn't want to be my pet, and it taught me a lesson about respecting animals in their natural habitat. They're not necessarily there for our pleasure by any means.",3,3
398,19,"A memorable moment was recently when I hosted a birthday party for my boyfriend. We rented out a hall and threw a party there. We recently moved to a different city so we have not seen our friends in a while. On his birthday we invited everybody down and had a good turn out. The theme of the party was more of a Hawaiian theme which everyone seemed to enjoy. There were lots of foods, drinks, music and games. 

Seeing everybody get together to celebrate this moment was special. There were also some unexpected gifts that he received. Our kids were also at this party and they put together a dance for their dads birthday. Our kids are young which makes this even cuter. To see his reaction to the dance was memorable. The smile on faces was such a positive feeling. 

Later on that night we ended up taken everybody back to our house. The hall was only rented out for a few hours and it went better than expected so we continued it at home. Some people spent the night since they could not drive back home. 

Waking up that next morning to a house full of people and laughs about the night before was also very memorable.",2,2
399,190,"The most recent and striking memory I have was when I was in the hospital to receive cycle 2 of chemotherapy for my recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Initially I was supposed to be in the hospital for only 3 days. This stint in the hospital ended up being for 6 days. 

The first day I arrived there to stay overnight, the chemo was not ready to be delivered so I had to stay there for the night for really no reason, away from my wife and daughter. The next day I had to get a CT scan that shouldn't have happened and they had initially thought that they found more cancer in my lungs. We now know that this diagnosis is not correct but it added to the trauma of this visit. Several doctors visited us and said that they wanted to potentially open my chest and take a biopsy of my lungs! 

Once my oncologist put the squash on this, they began chemotherapy. As soon as they got me hooked up to the chemo and the pump started moving it into my body, I had a systematic reaction. My throat closed up, my face swelled and went numb and turned purple, and I couldn't breath. They immediately stopped the treatment. 

Under this terrible stress I no longer wanted to take the treatment. The nurses convinced me otherwise and that I had to take the treatment to fight my cancer so I can still be here for my wife and daughter. So the next morning we tried again with a higher dilution rate and I didn't have a reaction. 

This was a very emotional moment for me because this chemo was going to keep me alive and kill my cancer. Unfortunately it didn't fully do its job though. I am still fighting cancer because it became resistant to prior treatment methods. We are currently trying MAB treatments to see if we can kill it that way and move onto stem cell transplant. 

I pray this works. I am 37 and have a wife and daughter that depend on me. I want to be here for them.",3,3
400,191,"I was visiting my girlfriend's family and we were having a good time at her mom's boyfriend's house where we were all playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate and enjoying some good food. However, while I was there and we were all relaxing I received a call from my mother who asked if I had spoken to one of my best friends. I replied and told her that I had been texting him but he hadn't replied for a while. She told me that she didn't know if it was true but that something had happened to his mother. I asked her what had happened and my mom told me that his mom had passed away. 

This was a weird situation as I had known his mother for almost my whole adult life so it didn't really feel as if it was possible for it to happen. I denied it immediately assuming it was a rumor since we all didn't know for sure. 

After about half an hour to an hour, my dad called me (he works with my best friend's mom) and told me that it was, in fact, true. My best friend's mom had passed away. There were no words to describe the feeling I felt. I didn't know what to say or how to act towards my best friend. This was a situation that was completely foreign to me. I had lost other people in my life but not anyone as close as a mother. 

It was a tough time but we all got through it and moved forward.",2,2
401,1910,"So, we recently went on a vacation to Utah, but we have other vacations coming up. We're going to go to London and Paris on one trip, and then the next trip, we're going to go to Alaska. I've been to Paris one time, and we just spent one day there, but we did so much stuff. We were on our way to West Africa in the Peace Corps. We went up in the Eiffel Tower, went to the Louvre, walked along the Seine, and went into Notre Dame. It was really impressive before it burned down. We saw the Arc de Triomphe. It was a really busy day. We've also been to Alaska before. We took an elder hostel trip in Glacier Bay, and it was just wonderful. We spent the entire week in Glacier Bay at an end that had delicious food. We went to the homes of the people who were our leaders. We got to see what it's like for people to live so far away from everything. We got to see how they store food for the winter and learned if they're more afraid of Moose, and that if you kill a Moose, it's hard to get all the meat in. You have to get friends or make long pack trips. But I'm hoping this next trip will also be fun. This time we will be going to Denali National Park and also the Kenai Peninsula.",1,1
402,194,"I have so many memories but the one which stands out most in my mind, heart and soul is the memory of my daughter getting her driver license. I know to many this may seem like just another day but to me it was bittersweet. 

We left for DMV on a beautiful sunny day. She was going to have to take the road test. She was talking a lot during the car ride there and during the long wait. I know the talking was just her being nervous about the test. She was nervous about driving with a stranger in the car. 

I was unsettled for other reasons. To me this was a milestone in our time together. She was getting a new kind of freedom. A whole new world was opening up for her. She had more freedom and even though this is the natural course for a young girl I couldn't help but dread the day a little. She has grown independent. She would not need me for that much longer. 

I know I did a great job with her and am very proud of her for passing that test with flying colors, It is just slowly moving closer to the time when she will be leaving to live her own life.",3,3
403,1941,"Yeah. So, when I was really young, I met this guy in school who was an avid reader, as was I, because my grandfather had a bookstore in a small mountain town in North India. I read a lot, but did not know a lot of people who read as much as I did. And upon meeting The Sky, it turned out that he enjoyed reading Harry Potter as much as I did, which was all the rage back then. We shared a love for reading and a certain set of series. Within a year, he had to leave and move to a different part of the country. Strangely, I never stopped feeling fondness towards him, even after nearly 20 years. There was an opportunity when I came across his profile online, and I reached out to him, saying I would be in India shortly. He seemed excited to see me too. The strangest thing was seeing him after about 18 years. It felt like nothing had changed between us. We connected like fast, old friends, picking up the conversation as though we had never been apart. Sometimes, you meet people you've spent years with just after a short gap, and you've grown apart in strange ways. Other times, you meet someone for a short while, a long time ago, and it's as though they've been on the journey with you. I think that's quite interesting; the connection you can have with certain people.",2,2
404,1944,"When I was maybe five or six years of age, we went to visit my cousins Linda and Clyde, who lived with their parents, my Uncle Eldred and Aunt Ruby, on a little farm not far from 5 and 1 Texas. Clyde, about eight or ten years older than me, would often take Linda and me on adventures as he was about to finish high school. On this particular day, we climbed up to the top of the Windmill tower and then went to a tree in the little forest near their house where we climbed up carefully to look at bird's nests with eggs. There were many trees in what we called a shelter belt, a strip of forest between farm plots, where different creatures lived. After looking at all the birds, we went back to my cousin's house to look them up in a big book. We then learned about the different kinds of birds. Clyde had two or three favorite birds, his absolute favorite being what we called the chicken hawk, a term for a bird big enough to carry off a chicken. We also had Sparrow Hawks, commonly called kestrels. We had great fun looking at the different kinds of birds, nests, and eggs, being careful not to disturb the parent birds. In another summer, Clyde had raised a baby redtail hawk after stealing an egg from a chicken hawk. he fed the hawk carefully as it grew to adulthood, coming around to where Clyde was and eating from a little tray from a distance. It was wonderful to watch the hawk eat the offerings.",2,2
405,1945,"I must have been about ten years of age when my family - my father, my mother, my sister, and I - went to stay at a tiny little town called Five and one Texas, close to my uncle and auntie's farm near Berlin, Texas. They didn't have enough room in the farmhouse for us, so we stayed in the town a few miles away. It was a tiny town with just a cotton gin, a store, a gas station, and a few houses. The house we stayed in was one of the earliest built in Will, Barter County, Texas, full of interesting stuff. The manager of the gym owned it and offered to rent it to us for $50 a month but we had to clean it up. We agreed, moved out old radios and trunks full of stuff into a shed-like room. Among the items was a Confederate army uniform from the 1860s with a belt and buckle that said ""CSA."" We fixed up the house but upon returning one day, we found it in flames. The owner had burned everything. We salvaged the ashes into a garden and stayed in the house for six weeks, working the fields for watermelons and cotton. It was a very interesting summer in Five and one Texas.",1,1
406,1946,"When I was maybe six or seven years old, we lived in Gruber, Texas. Our neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Meeks, had a daughter named Jane who babysat for us. The Meeks family owned a movie theater. On Saturday mornings, I helped clean up the theater with Mr. Meeks and Jane. It was a messy job - we picked up popcorn boxes, soda cups, and swept the floor. In exchange for my help, I got to watch a movie and have popcorn and a cold drink. I loved going to the theater, even though I couldn't go into the projection room. Mr. Meeks let me stand at the door and watch him work. I enjoyed seeing all the mechanics behind showing a movie on the screen from high up in the back. They showed cereals, cartoons, and the main movie on Saturday mornings starting at 10:00. My friends were proud and maybe a bit jealous that I got to be there before the movie opened. It was an exciting part of town where families dropped off their kids for the movie before going about their day. Helping clean up the Moving Picture Theater was a wonderful little job that I had.",2,2
407,1947,"Now, I don't know if you got the story about picking the cotton, but here's another one: about picking cotton when I was avoiding. At the end of the year after the cotton was harvested, the field would have to be plowed under, and there might be some remnants of cotton still left. The cotton plants were all dried out, but there were still some fibers left on the plants. So the farmer I worked for, Mr. and Mrs. Hale, would come out on a Saturday morning and get me. I would go back to their farm, and they would go quickly through the field, picking the low amount of cotton that was left after most of the leaves were gone and most of the plants were all dried up. While they were running through the fields quickly picking the remains of the cotton, I would be putting gasoline in their old tractor. They had a wonderful big farm oil tractor that I liked and enjoyed working with that machine. I would check the oil and I would fill it up with gasoline. I would take some from a standing tank and put it into a small can. Then we'd get over to the tractor and put it into the tank of the tractor. I would check the spark plugs and make sure everything was in good shape. Then I would start it up and I would plow under the old cotton peel, which was a very interesting chore. I would make a spiral starting at the outside of the field. And we used what was called a disc herald, a kind of plow that will turn the soil over and simply cut up all the plants and get the soil ready for it to be lying and fallow for a few months before the next planting season. They would put all the vegetative matter back into the soil so that it could compost and make the soil richer. It was not a precise job. I could make a spiral. I did not have to keep a careful rule like you do if you're planting or cultivating or harvesting. The plowing under is very free-form and it was a great fun to make a big spiral around the outside of the field, making it smaller and smaller with every circle of the field. There would be a lot of animals, like the cottontail rabbits, occasionally a jackrabbit, sometimes a quail, and occasionally rattlesnakes that you would see after you'd chopped up and broken the soil of one place. Those animals would go to the middle of the field. As the middle of the field got smaller and smaller, where there was vegetation, then the animals would take off and go to cover outside of the field. So it was very interesting and exciting to see all those different creatures leaving the field and going to what we call a berm, which is a place outside the field that was full of vegetation, a good place for the animals to hide.",1,1
408,195,"My daughter decided to play fast pitch softball and just finished their tournament in 2nd place. During her last game a month ago, she hit a double and even caught a few balls in the outfield. I was so proud of her and the achievements she has made over the past few months playing softball. 

The double was a huge deal for her. She knew that she hit the sweet spot on the bat because she could hear the familiar sound. She was at a 3-2 count so anything could have happened. She could have let her nerves wear her down and just strike out. 

However, she was patient and focused. She was able to harness her potential and made a big play for her team. She immediately ran to first base and then second with seconds to spare. A runner was able to make it home and score. 

We were ahead with two out and my daughter on second. She was eventually batted in and scored a run to place the team two points ahead. They barely won the game but they also learned a very important lesson. 

Sometimes you have to face down your fear to make great things happen.",3,3
409,1950,"When I was about twelve years old, my family lived in Texas most of the year, but in New Mexico for the summers. We built cabins, little houses, and sold them for profit, getting to know people around us in Ruidoso. We went to a little church where the minister had a daughter, Eileen, who was my age. Eileen and I were friends with the kids at the church, and we played mini-golf on Monday nights at a course owned by one of the fellows there. On Wednesday nights, there was choir practice, and Sunday there were church services. One day, Eileen asked me out on a date, my very first date ever.

We met at the roller skating rink in Ruidoso on a crowded Saturday afternoon, and I paid for her entrance. She showed me how to order shoes and tie them up, giving me a roller skating lesson before we spent an hour and a half skating together. Her parents came to pick her up for a family dinner, so I said my goodbyes and thanked her for a great time before heading home. I excitedly shared my first date experience with my family, who congratulated me on a good time roller skating with Eileen.",2,2
410,1953,"To call this story ""The Snow Day,"" I grew up in a very small town called Christoval, in the middle of a bunch of ranches and farms where only a couple of hundred people lived. One Saturday night after a basketball tournament, my friend Manuel was going to stay at my house and then go to church with my family. My father, who was the superintendent of schools, decided there would be no school on Monday after it started snowing early that morning. Manuel ended up staying with us the whole day and the following Monday. The snow began melting off around 10:00 in the morning, but school was still canceled. So, Manuel and I drove 20 miles to San Angelo on Monday afternoon to watch a James Bond movie. At the end of the movie, we went to an A&W Root Beer place for hamburgers, French fries, and root beer. Unfortunately, my old car wouldn't start after our meal, but luckily Manuel's cousins were at the restaurant and helped us push-start the car. We then made it back home over the snowy roads to Nicobacher where Manuel lived, while I went back to my home in Christoval. Overall, it was a beautiful and snowy day off from school, making it one of my favorite snow days ever.",2,2
411,1954,"The video I'm about to describe was in early June of 1964 when my family moved to a new town. I was 16 and sad because I left a lot of friends behind in the old town where I had lived for 8 years. My parents found better jobs in the new town, so we moved. Around 6:00 a.m. on my first night in our new house, I heard knocking and found two guys my age named Philip and Bobby at the door. They asked if I was Fred and invited me fishing. Surprised, I was told to also wear work clothes because they got me a job. My dad greeted them, and we had coffee and biscuits. We then drove to the river to check the trotline they set up to catch catfish. After catching some fish, we went to haul hay in the countryside for about 6 hours. Back in town, we had watermelon for lunch. I made friends with boys and girls living there, including Manuel and Oscar. We had a swim in the river and went our separate ways. I went home for a nap, and my dad asked how my first day was. I said it was wonderful, and I was glad we moved there.",2,2
412,1955,"All right, so today, I wanted to talk about the moment when I faced an unexpected setback in my career development and how it changed my perspective of growth. I think more than about two and a half years ago, I was working one full-time position at a startup and handling another part-time job at another startup. I was also doing one pro bono job at a nonprofit organization and a freelance gig for another nonprofit organization. I was handling like four jobs at the same time, which was crazy if I think about it. But I don't know why that happened, but I just happened to have a lot of tasks, and I didn't decline any of the work because I was hungry for career growth and wanted to accept challenges to grow my skills much faster.

Also, this was possible because one of my full-time positions at the startup was back in South Korea, so I was working full-time during the daytime and part-time during the day for the other startup in Santa Clara, California. I was doing freelance and pro bono work during the weekend. So this was possible time-wise, but this definitely wasn't good for my mental health. I was going through a lot of pressure and stress. I wasn't as skilled using the software and didn't have a lot of experience, so I wasn't as confident as I am now. I was going through a lot of mental stress and actually had to learn some stuff while I was doing the work at the same time. I had an issue with prioritizing what's important and what's not, and some work had to be pushed back. It was definitely a very hard time. I wasn't doing well back at home because I was very stressed at work, easily losing my temper with my partner. I didn't have much time to relax. So not a lot, but I slept like a decent amount, but I still didn't feel like I was energetic or invigorated because of the stress, I guess. That was also very anxious. So a lot of things were happening.

But I did that because if I had some leisure time, I didn't know what to do with my leisure time and felt like I was wasting my time. I wanted to catch up with my career because I entered this path pretty late compared to many other people. So I wanted to catch up quickly with my skills and with my career. So I didn't want to waste my time. So I felt like keeping myself busy would help me to be more progress, help me to grow. I just wanted to keep myself busy with a lot of tasks. But obviously, it didn't work well because it was too much work and too much pressure. And I wasn't ready for it, I guess. All those challenges, so one of my coworkers at my full-time position felt with my coworker, and he quit because of that. I was laid off from my part-time position because I couldn't deliver what I promised. One of my full-time positions at another startup in Korea also didn't go well. The company was facing south, and it was going south. So I landed on another company in South Korea by recommendation from a coworker. So all my hard work, these challenges, didn't pay off as much as I wished. I went through very I went through a little depression because of all that because I didn't end up achieving what I said at the beginning. I thought I would be very successful at handling everything, but it didn't. So I was very disappointed in myself. And I even felt guilty and bad about myself because of all the situations like I was laid off, I fought with my coworker, and he quit. So I felt guilty, and I thought I was doing something wrong. I just reflected on myself a lot. And it wasn't good. 

Anyway, so I have to think back and reassess what I was doing and why all this was happening. And since I quit after a couple of months, I told the nonprofit that I would stop doing the pro bono work, and I kind of clear all the other tasks and just focus on the full-time position. So I had some time to think about my past work and experiences that I had. And instead of keeping myself busy with all those challenges, I decided to invest in new hobbies. I just took some online classes for drawing and registered for personal training to exercise. So I filled those void with some other build of outer field of life. I guess I filled it with my hobbies. And all that instead of keeping myself busy with the career-related work. I think it actually helped me to recover from the bad experience. It helped me to, I think, develop other interests in life other than the career. Really helped me because it paid back. For example, I started to connect my other interests and use that interest to inspire myself and push myself in my career. I started to realize that sometimes, being productive, trying to be productive, I need to have a more rich experience and grow internally other than just keeping myself busy and doing external work. I hope it makes sense.",3,3
413,1956,"Okay, so today, I want to talk about how my perspective about my background or my family lineage has changed. My father is pretty conservative, and he emphasized a lot about our family background from a prestigious family with high-ranking scholars and queens. He always emphasized that we are a prestigious family and should be successful in society. As a child, I felt proud, but as I grew up, it seemed like such a long time ago, back in the Jeonju or Goryeo Dynasty. I always thought my father must not be very happy about his accomplishments in life, which is why he focused on finding glory from the past. I was more focused on my individuality rather than my family background. Nowadays, people in the democratic world care about their ancestors, and as I immigrated to the United States, I realized the importance of collective power and being part of a community. Being part of the MIT community helped me network and get a job, showing how the group you belong to can be meaningful. In the US, I thought more about my identity as a Korean American and my ancestral lineage. Although I had a negative perspective towards South Korea before, I now think more about it and want to make a positive impact like my ancestors did. I believe that finding a group and connecting with a larger community can bring positive changes to society. I am proud of my ancestors and want to make a positive impact as a South Korean immigrant. I now think about a bigger picture than myself and hope to make my future children proud.",2,2
414,1958,"All right, so today I want to share a story about my marriage. I got married in 2016 when I was around 20. I didn't think I would marry my husband a year before I got married to him. Everything evolved fast with environmental issues involved, leading to my decision to marry him. I've been married to my husband since 2015, now 2020, right? Seven years. I reflect on my marriage to discuss the pros and cons, as I've noticed some negative perceptions towards marriage in South Korea. I had a conventional perspective before I got married due to media influence and family discussions. I was scared of not finding a partner as I got older. The fear of missing my prime time and not being able to sell myself also influenced my decision to get married. I believed my husband was trustworthy and sincere, which was crucial for a successful marriage. Over the years, I saw some pros of marriage, like saving money and focusing on other life tasks once the marriage task was completed. Building a family matured me, despite the challenges and arguments we faced. We negotiated and compromised our differences, leading to a more mature relationship. Having my husband's emotional support made me feel more stable and less lonely. However, there were cons, such as having to work more to take care of each other emotionally and compromising on interests. Less freedom and excitement were also noted as cons. It's important to marry someone with similar values to shape life decisions together. Getting to know your partner well before marriage is crucial as their values and judgments can influence your life significantly.",2,2
415,1960,"Okay, so I want to talk about something I noticed recently. I feel different when interacting with certain groups. I'm more comfortable with some people than others. The issue is that it's based on race. I wanted to figure out why and also because I felt bad. Honestly, I feel more comfortable speaking to African Americans. When I speak to white Americans, I feel intimidated, like I'm putting my guard up. I'm more careful about what I say, going through censorship. It's weird, and I want to feel more like myself regardless of who I'm interacting with. Most biases come from past experiences. I reflected on my past and saw I had better experiences with African Americans. When I was 14, I studied abroad in Canada. I was the only person of color and had a hard time mingling due to cultural barriers. Nobody would sit next to me, which hurt. I felt transparent and gave up trying to make friends. This experience has had a lasting impact on me. I avoided similar situations. Memories were affecting me without my awareness. I felt fear when interacting with similar people. I had a positive experience at an African American university when I was 20. I was more mature and had an easier time making friends. It was easy to mingle as a group. Reflecting on past experiences has helped me realize my biases. Now, I strive to be more open-minded and aware of my feelings towards different groups.",3,3
416,1962,"Okay. So I moved to the US in 2016, but for the past couple of years, I only worked for Korean companies or Korean-owned companies due to some circumstances. I was really curious to know about the corporate cultures in the US and how the workplace culture is like in the US. Since I started to work for a US company starting from last week, I'm really excited and a little bit overwhelmed about this new experience, but mostly I'm excited. Starting from the onboarding or background check and everything was very stressful even before I start working for the company. I only worked for companies in a smaller size so I haven't really been through this rigorous background check. I was actually very surprised at how the companies were conducting background checks very rigorously. It was a bit surprising, but I was very glad that I didn't write any false experience or anything misleading in my resume. Everything that I wrote on the resume was I was able to prove it. So I was really glad for myself. I learned that I really need to be honest in every situation because I never know what's coming in the future. So that was like one of the insights that I gained during this onboarding experience. I've learned that US corporate culture is much more parallel and they encourage collaborations, open discussion, very much so. It seems like a relationship with the peers is really important. I'm a little bit of an introvert so I'm not always very proactively approach people, but I feel like I have to because I'm the new person here, so I have to be more proactive and approach other team members and introduce myself, be more friendly to make new connections. So that's another thing that I've learned from this experience. I learned that the team really encourages me to get involved as much as I can in other projects and be very proactive and take initiative, speak up during the meetings. So I guess it's very different from Korean culture in Korean corporate culture. If you are being overly engaging and if you take initiative, even if you're a newcomer, then it's a little bit it means it's a little bit people could give you. It could leave a bad impression because it makes you look like you are overly confident or overly rude. It could come across as a rude person, but I learned it's necessary and I need to look confident and say confidently when I communicate with my coworkers. Because if I act or say things that make me look humble, then it could easily come across as a lack of confidence in the US. I'm trying to be more cautious thinking about that. So I'm trying to calibrate myself to the US corporate culture. These are the three things that I've learned so far, and I'm trying to adapt to the new environment. I feel good about this new team and the new company and my position as well. I'm really glad that I had this opportunity. I'm really happy about it. I'm looking forward to sharing more insight as I work in this company.",2,2
417,1968,"So, I'm a design researcher, a product researcher, a UX researcher, whatever you want to call it. Design researcher everywhere I go, I introduce kind of new things and new approaches to my jobs and my coworkers, and fortunately, I keep getting a lot of positive feedback, like, ""Oh, I'm so glad to work with you. Oh, this is so interesting."" I find it to be less because I'm more skilled or more knowledgeable than anyone else. I just know what's right to do for the research objective. Maybe in that way, I just propose more, like, maybe I'm just more ambitious. But it's scary and it's harder, and maybe that's why people don't do it, but I feel a responsibility to do it. I find that inspires people. It's really difficult for me, a constant path of learning. I always have to learn something new, kind of a burden, and I understand why people wouldn't really want to do that. It's tiring. But I hope it will be rewarding, and it seems like the right thing to do. It seems like the right answer, and I think it'll get me where I want to be as a researcher in my career, making the amount of money that I want to make, with the titles that I want to have, at the companies that I want to work for. I'm glad I have some people on my team that support me, but it's scary and it's hard, and I always have to learn, and I never have enough resources.",2,2
418,1969,"I'm going to tell you about a really difficult time in my life, both stressful and emotionally challenging. It's the story of my miscarriage and trying to switch career paths. Not this past June, but a year from last June, I had been submitting my application for a new career shift into product design. During that process, I found out I had become pregnant accidentally. I was emotionally struggling with the idea of applying for a job and having a child unexpectedly at 40 with all the costs. Not to say having a child is all burdens, but there's a big financial situation to stress about. I reached out to my company contact and was excited to hear it wouldn't deter them from a potential job fitting. I had come around to the idea of having a child and we all got really excited. My son was too. Then, in the same week on a Tuesday, I went to the doctor and there was no heartbeat. That was really surprising and emotionally stressful. I was about twelve weeks along and had to figure out what to do. I decided to have surgery. On Wednesday, I had to figure out my miscarriage and prep for my final job interview the next day. Alongside that was the frustrating financial cost of surgery with little healthcare support. Wednesday was busier with hospital talks and scheduling my appointment while also preparing for the whiteboarding challenge in the job interview. The job interview on Thursday went great, but I didn't know if I got the job. Friday morning at 05:00 A.M., I had the surgery which was emotionally challenging. Later that day, I found out I got the job. Throughout it all, I was trying not to feel too much because it would break me down. Saturday morning, I finally let it all out and felt both relieved and supported by my partner. It was a week full of unexpected challenges, but it showed me I can handle a lot and make my way through it.",3,3
419,197,"I had never had a pet but I always wanted to. However my mom would always say no because there was nobody home to take care of a pet. I had hamsters, fish and other small pets, but I wanted a real pet that I could pet and feed. I think it had to be a dog because I don't like cats. 

Well, I had never thought about a rabbit. It was in a magic show that we had where this cutie pie was. I loved her when I first saw it. I think rabbits are so cute but I had never been close to one. 

Well, I participated to be able to get her as mine. I didn't think of what my parents could say. but soon she was given to me and I could take her home. It was funny that my mom didn't like her at first, but a few days later she was just in love with this fluffy thing. 

I have read a lot about rabbits to be able to take care of her. I love her. She is growing fast and likes to be pet, which I love because I thought rabbits always wanted to be alone. No, she loves to be whenever there are people and likes to lick and be pet, and gets excited when we come home just like a dog.",2,2
420,1971,"So today, I'm going to talk about a revelation I had over the weekend after talking with my partner. I realized that I've been bullied in my office, which is a really new territory for me because I'm older. I have about 20 years of experience, and I've never come across this. I woke up Sunday morning, just woke up really early. My brain started churning, and I started to cry and just feeling miserable because I'm just spinning in my head about why this one coworker, this product manager, is just so outwardly horrendous. For a while there, it's been kind of a series of patterns over the last nine months. It was difficult because this was a new career path for me. Initially, I was thinking, oh, well, I have a lot of gaps to fill, I don't know. Push a project forward with feeling like I was being incompetent. There were times when she completely lashed out at me and was like, ""This is not design!"" and just really erratic behavior. I try to bring up on the group channel like, ""Hey, I need some review on this,"" and she'll just pick out the most random things to be like, ""Well, this is not best us practice. I'm wondering why you did this,"" and send me a Nielsen Norman article across the chat. If I try to ask questions about the progress of a product in one of our features and development, she'll just give me a blank answer and then ask our program manager to tell the group what the purpose of this feature is. It's been really, kind of jarring her behavior. At first I just thought, okay, she's an aggressive personality. Then I tried to find patterns with other people, and it wasn't there. And so I definitely went inward until I actually just took a step back and was doing some online research about workplace bullying. It is what she is doing, it's outward yelling at fellow coworkers in meetings, which is obvious. But then it's other things, like overly micromanaging every little detail or pointing out constant ridicule or actually talking in platitudes that are really hard to defend against. It's withholding information. It's not bringing team members in as part of when decision making is happening. It's been a complete, repeated pattern. It actually feels really good because I've been able to identify what the behavior is and to realize honestly that I'm doing a great job. It's not on me. I've had an office bully. It sounds really funny also to say. It's hard to bring up because it's not an easy pattern to identify because it's not across the board in every situation with other coworkers, I mean. It's a really targeted micro like aggression. To me, it sounds silly to bring up because it's almost like schoolyard playground behavior. I really try not to play a victim, very assertive. So I just kind of was shrugging it off as, ""Alright, it's just a different personality to work with,"" but it's actually a behavior in the workplace and it feels really good to have identified it so I can just release and put it for what it is.",3,3
421,1975,"Over here, the story I'm going to share today is about my trip home and rediscovering some new but very old clothing. Growing up, I feel like I never really had a sense of style because my mom would just buy all my clothes for me; she knew my sizes, she knew how to look for clothing on sale - she's really good at that. So, I never really had to worry about, like, ""Oh, what clothes do I wear?"" because there was just a bunch of clothing to pick from. But she also knew my style, which was, like, not my taste, but what I didn't like - super bold, bright colors, scary patterns, and prints - so I would typically just wear very basic, neutral clothing. As of recently, I think I've been a little bit more adventurous and exploratory with my clothing; I've been wearing more color, wearing more styles, not just the shorts and shirt every day, but sometimes a dress. Now I have an interest in shoes, which is exciting - I never really was a shoe person until now because I worked in labs all my life, so I was always wearing, like, sneakers, but now I'm like, ""Yeah, it would be nice to kind of have some heels once in a while."" So, I went home and, in addition to some shopping, most of the clothing I brought back from my trip was actually old clothes that my mom had bought when she was younger, as well as clothing that my sister doesn't wear anymore. She's younger than me, but we have the same-ish size and body, so I can steal from her closet. It's kind of incredible that my mom has saved clothing for, like, 20 years and now she's passing them to me, and they're still such good quality, so cool and trendy - that's just really enjoyable. I'm glad that I was able to get some clothing from home from my mom physically - it makes me think about the clothing I buy now and whether or not it's even worth passing on to my kids and how long those pieces will last, staying in style. But I have a lot to learn, so I definitely don't know enough about fashion, but I think it's really cool, and I want to learn more.",2,2
422,1977,"So this is the story of going perfume shopping with my mom. Originally, we went to the mall not to buy perfume, but to try on dresses for my white coat ceremony coming up. But in the mall, there are a bunch of different stores, and my mom doesn't really go out on her own to shop. She likes having someone shopping with her. My dad is too busy with work, so when I went home, she spent time with me. We decided just to go through some random stores because why not? We were there already, and I noticed one of the brands that I really like now called Boutique. I really wanted to show my mom the perfume that I had gotten over the summer as a gift from someone, but they sold out of it because it was limited edition. Instead, I introduced her to a bunch of other scents, knowing that she really likes jasmine because I also like jasmine. She tried it on, and we left. Then she had to go back. It was like we only walked like ten steps out of the store before she was like, no, I should do this for myself. So we went back in and we got her the perfume. It's really nice. I think my mom is someone who is always afraid to spend money because we don't have a lot of it. So she's really frugal, but we're at a place financially where my family can be nicer and more spendy. I was really happy that she was able to buy a perfume that she really liked. We went home, she unboxed it, sprayed some on, loved the smell. I'm so happy. It makes her happy. She's super deserving of it. And now I have a memory that every time I go home and smell jasmine or smell jasmine in my day-to-day life, I'll think of my mom and the perfume we got together.",3,3
423,1979,"Today, I hung up a shelf in my apartment; my dad is quite the handyman at home. If our toilet ever has problems, he fixes it, and if our car ever breaks down, he's the one who fixes it as well. So for most of my life, he's the one who puts hardware together and sets things up. As part of moving into this apartment, we have some furniture that was just laying on the ground. I was like, ""Okay, it should be time you just put it up somewhere, like, make our home feel like a home."" So for the first time in my life, ever, I use a screwdriver to drill a hole in the wall manually, and then stuck the two like drywall plastic bits in. It was honestly quite a struggle, and I was sweating. Without the help of my roommate, I would have definitely failed. But now it's hanging up there, and we have books on it; it's really cute. I'm just so happy that we did this, and kind of proud too. I knew I was kind of capable, but to actually just have followed through and finished this tiny little project feels really good. So that's my shelf over there, which is why I keep looking over there; that's my story for this session.",2,2
424,1980,"Yeah, so like I kind of mentioned already, today was a really stormy day, but I already had made plans with my program little to hang out. It's my first time really hanging out with her outside of campus at her apartment, my first time being in our apartment. So this morning, I woke up and decided to go to Whole Foods. I walked, like 30 minutes in the rain to go to Whole Foods to pick up flowers, really cute bottles, and some groceries. I spent a long time looking for flowers, trying to find ones that would fit her personality. I got her an arrangement with a bunch of different flowers in a really nice glass vase. It was super fun. We hung out, talked a lot, played three games of pool, and made a Chinese dessert called Simulu, which is like tapioca pearls with fruits and coconut milk. It was really yummy. Then I came home while it was still raining. So today, if it wasn't for my little and having so much stuff to do, I think I would have been just as gloomy as the weather. It made me really happy to have done so much today. Yes, that's my story.",2,2
425,1981,"Yes, so today for dinner, I went out with the Crabstones in my lab because we were celebrating the return of a rotation student. Usually in our program, there are a lot of PhD programs. Your first year is spent rotating, working in different labs until you find your home lab. We had an MD, PhD student rotate for his second rotation. We were sad when he went for his third and hopeful that he would come back. He officially started today and it was super fun. We cleaned out his bench together. I think our lab is just really nice in the sense that we like to leave the lab once in a while and help each other. We had a little dinner together and tried a lot of different dishes because we did Family Style, which is so much more fun than getting things for yourself to eat. One of the fun things was at the end of the night, while we were leaving, I was brave enough to ask the waitress lady if I could take one of the plant propagations. They have a lot of plants in that restaurant, all of them decorating like little glass bowls. ""Can I have one, please?"" I said. I think it was really brave of me because I normally would never ask. But I really wanted one of those plants. They are so cute. The lady said, ""Yeah, sure."" She handed me one and I felt so, like, wow. Brave. Also, like, yeah, it's not too scary to ask. What's the worst that could happen? If she said no, bummer. Okay, yeah, understandable. But I was kind of proud of myself that I was able to ask for a little plant propagation, and hopefully I'll keep it growing and add another plant to my plant family. So yeah, that's my story of today.",2,2
426,1983,"Six years ago, a matchmaking site called ""Book lovers"" (this was before the internet) matched me with a man named Matters from California, who seemed perfect to me - interested in everything and attractive too. He decided to move to Pennsylvania to be with me, as my family owned a week in this house. Very quickly, it became evident that he was responsible but lacked motivation. He would just read books and waste time. To encourage him to do something, I suggested he go back to school and learn computer programming, which was guaranteed to be a very good career at the time. I paid for his tuition so he could learn about programming, showing how old the story is. He would go off to school, and I was proud of him for working hard and learning how to program. One day, a friend of mine who lived at the school he attended told me that my boyfriend really likes to read and would come to the library and leave magazines. When he got back that day, I confronted him about it and told him that I couldn't put up with his lack of ambition in my life. It was the best decision I ever made, and it felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.",2,2
427,1986,"No gbo, this was not recent at all, this was many decades ago while I was still in high school in the early 70s. My friends and I participated in an activity called Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science, a science fair where high school kids from the area competed for awards. You had to present the results of the research that you did. So at the time, I was very interested in microbiology, well before smartphones that you can use to take micrographs. I had to jury-rig a contraption with an old box camera poised over the eyepiece of my microscope, and a little fishbowl with a light bulb for temperature control. I had a hay infusion to collect some protozoa and used this to conduct experiments about different things that can affect protozoa in their insisted dormant stage. I presented at the local meeting of this. My boyfriend at the time also presented a project which he claimed showed that baby chicks could be conditioned while they were still in their eggs. And to do this, he wrapped wires around some fertilized eggs and attached the wires to a Big Ben alarm clock, one of those really, really loud, old-fashioned alarm clocks. Every day, he would set this alarm off so the bell would ring. So when the chicks finally hatched, he then set off the alarm clock and they, of course, went crazy, running around and cheeping squawking. He claimed that this was because they were conditioned while they were filling the egg to respond to the sound. The obvious, obvious question was, ""Well, don't you think that any chicks conditioned or not would go crazy with this huge sound, this very scary alarm?"" But when he presented, the judges didn't ask that question, and they in fact awarded him a first prize for this project. I got honorable mention, and it turned out the reason why I only got an honorable mention was that they didn't think that I did this project without any help. So you see, jivo, 50 odd years later, this still bothers me, but I did learn a valuable lesson about the just world fallacy.",2,2
428,1988,"Well, I was in graduate school and a member of various fandoms before the Internet. Fandoms consisted of fanzines that you got through the mail. Through these fanzines, I heard about a medieval reenactment organization that did a lot of really great activities. It sounded like something I would love to get involved with. Where I live, this wasn't an option. There were no local groups in this reenactment society. But I went to Penn State for my doctorate, and they had a branch group on campus for this reenactment society. So I met with the person in charge, and he set me up with all the information that I needed.

When I got back home after graduate school was finished, I decided to start my own local group. So I did this totally from scratch. I didn't have anybody that I personally knew who would be interested in this. So I actually submitted a little invitation in the newspaper and set up a meeting at the local library for anyone who would be interested in joining. I was so nervous that day, I was so nervous that people wouldn't show up, that I had a physical reaction. My stomach was in knots. I couldn't endure the tension.

But the day came, and I went to the library. And when I saw about ten people sitting there waiting for me, I felt such relief. And I felt such pride. In the years since, the local group that I started has become recognized. They have had many more members join and have hosted various events. And I am very proud of what I accomplished that day.",3,3
429,199,"Today was a terrible day for me. My co-worker, who we will call the big ""W"" is usually always mean to me. However, today she was the worst. It was our big Christmas party, and she micromanaged everyone at work today. She started openly complaining about only she was smart, only she did any real work, etc. 

Everyone had told me since I started here how terrible she was and how badly they wanted her to be fired. Despite this, no one would ever do anything about her or talk about her until she left the room. 

Finally I snapped and decided not to sit down and take it like everyone else. While she started insisting she told me to do something I was never told, I told her to her face she never said that. She lost it and started to scream at me, while she did that my boss just ignored it like he usually did. 

I decided I had enough of a boss that wouldn't do anything and handed him my resignation, which was more than he deserved. He tried to convince me it was cowardly to leave, but I told him it was cowardly to not fire her. 

She kept harassing me through the night until that point, then my boss decided to take her to the back room and yell at her for having a coworker finally quit over her. She came back out and stayed quiet for the whole rest of the night. 

I left that job and felt good about leaving, they all already didn't like her but it was made worse once she actually cost them a good employee who at least tried their best which was more than half of the people they hired did.",3,3
430,1995,"So, not sure how to start this story, I have a lot of friends, which is a lovely thing, but it means that, depending on the week or the season, I hang out with some people more than others. I have had a relatively new friend called Luisa, who I thought we were on the same page as far as how often we could hang out, and I hadn't seen her for a while. She travels during the summer and the fall as she's an instructor, she's a professor, so as soon as summer comes, she's gone for the entire duration of the summer, which is several months. She goes to Columbia, and then she does the same when it's the holiday time from like Christmas, and we've gotten used to not really contacting each other during the time when she's out of the country, even when she's in the country, we see each other sporadically, which I thought was fine. I enjoy her company, she's very funny, she's got a good sense of humor. I like her husband, they're nice eggs, good eggs. But it turns out that we had a misunderstanding about how often we'd hang out together, and she kind of gave me a severe talking to a while ago about not hanging out with her which I think had the opposite effect of what she hoped, now I just feel guilty when I don't hang out with her, and when I do hang out with her, I feel like I'm doing it out of obligation. All that to say, she is having a baby shower this Saturday, tomorrow, and I have yet to RSVP, I think I'm not going to go, I don't like baby showers at all. We haven't talked to each other, and I think it'd be really awkward to go to a kind of intimate event without having spoken to her first, but I think it will seal the fate of the relationship, I think this will be the last straw. So, I'm going to do it, but it's on my mind as the day approaches.",2,2
431,1997,"So, I had the Open House event, and then a good friend of mine from grad school wanted to take a trip to Portland for a few days afterwards. The Open House was on Sunday, and we left on Tuesday for a few days. I just returned last night, which was Friday, Saturday night, and during the vacation, I received a notice from the Austin City Code people that the activity I'd hoped to have in the space, which is the art Studios, goes against city code. Honestly, I had hoped to be able to stand at the radar and host artists in the space without really raising the flags with the city. I think that's the way arts organizations have worked in Austin, in residential areas. Artists just get together and work at each other's homes and no one's the wiser per se. But I think my error is that I put some Flyers in neighbors' mailboxes, just like four up the street, and one kind of across from me, like my nearest neighbors, and someone didn't like the activity and reported me to the city. So, that was a big shocker on vacation because I really don't have that much of a Plan B for this property. I've spent 26 months renovating.",2,2
432,2,"About 2 months ago, one of our employees had a breakdown due to his family leaving. His family left him due to personal issues that they've been having. I was called because his neighbors thought that he had suicidal ideation due to his wife and kids leaving, and was advised that he had weapons in his house. 

At this time, I was very scared and it took me a moment before I realized what I needed to do. This man needs help immediately and that he can't be alone. So, I called the cops and responded to his home and found out that he wasn't suicidal but was just going through a lot. 

I asked him if he needs someone to be with him or if he wants to stay the night over in my place. He replied saying he just wants to be alone and that everyone deals with problems differently. He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. 

The next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals. 

His family came back home and they have been doing really well. He continues to attend Alcohol Anonymous meetings and continues to build his network of friends that he can rely on.",2,2
433,20,"A few months ago at the Styx concert, He surprised me and proposed. After 13 years of being together, I actually never thought it would happen. 

The song ""Lady"" started and he gave his phone to a person we didn't know behind us. I thought that was really strange but it didn't dawn on me that there could be any other reason but that he wanted someone to take our picture together. That annoyed me because I don't like getting my picture taken. 

The next think I new, he was talking in my ear so I could hear him over the loud music and then he got down on one knee. Next he held out a ring he pulled from his pocket. I started crying and said, ""yes, definitely yes!"". I was in total shock. 

Even though I don't like to have my picture taken, I'm so glad he had someone videotape the proposal. It's really funny to see the shocked look on my face. 

After the proposal, he told me that he first got permission from my girls and my dad as well. I thought that was a very noble gesture and something that he didn't have to do. 

Now we have a wedding to plan. I feel so blessed to marry the love of my life who is also my best friend. I wonder how I ever got so lucky.",3,3
434,200,"Roughly 3 weeks ago me and my girlfriend of a year broke up. It had been coming for a while, but i do not think it was something i was ready to fully accept. About 4 months ago, she got very sick. During this period where she was sick, she was completely bed ridden and i did not get to see her often. 

There was a lot of tension between us because of this. It started with us starting to say hateful stuff towards each other. I would tell her that i hated i never got too see her, and that it felt like i was not even in a relationship. She told me that she's sorry i felt that way, but I needed to get over myself. This of course, hurt me very much. 

We had been friends for years before we even considered dating, and the relationship was starting to fade. I could not bring myself to end it at the time, so we continued. The situation worsened as time went on. We went from remarks, to full on hating each other. She would come over and i would tell her that i did not want to see her. I started having anxiety attacks thinking about what the relationship was coming to. 

When my birthday came around, I sat her down and told her that I was seriously not happy with the relationship, and it needed to end. She agreed and i have not talked to her since. This event has been very hard on me as, because this was someone i wanted to build a life with and within one night, it was all gone.",3,3
435,2001,"Today, all week we have been on the warning for a Hurricane here on the North Shore in Massachusetts, and it's always a little worrisome. You have to get your extra groceries in the house and all that. I live about 2 miles from the ocean. So a friend came out this afternoon. We went to the beach to watch the waves. Right before these storms come in, the waves go crazy and it's really clear that a storm is brewing. So the sky was still blue and it was actually quite pretty. But it still means that a storm is brewing, so it's going to happen tomorrow. It's no longer a Hurricane, but they say it's going to be a pretty fierce storm with high winds. So we'll see what it brings tomorrow. It's part of living near the Coast. A lot of things for tomorrow have been canceled, outdoor concerts, art shows, etc. But I think it will be fine. I'm okay as long as we keep the power going because that's always a danger of these storms. That a tree falls on the lines and all that and we do get power outages living so near the coast. It always makes me feel like, yeah, I can prepare for this. It will be good, and the sun will come out again. And it will be interesting to see what tomorrow brings. As long as we keep the power, I should be okay.",2,2
436,2003,"Okay, here's my story for today, recently, we had a documentary film festival here in town and I sat through quite a few movies. One of them has been staying on my mind. It was a documentary about four students from Africa, places like Rwanda, Nigeria, countries like that, who got a scholarship to study at MIT. It was quite fascinating to see where these people came from, how they adjusted to life in Cambridge. The weather is different, food is different, social norms are different, the culture is different, and they have to perform at a very high level. It was very interesting to watch these students as they went home. They really wanted to contribute to their country, the things they had learned at MIT, some with good results and others not so. They were all, in the beginning, very serious about going back to their countries. In the end, only one went back, one of them is half in the US and half in the country where she came from. It was really interesting to watch as I'm an immigrant myself, and it definitely resonated with me. The next day, I had a young man coming to fix my Wi-Fi from Haiti, who moved to this country to escape a very bad situation in Haiti. He is now in school and during the day makes money fixing people's TVs, Wi-Fi, and whatever you have. We got to talk a bit, even though he never, ever wants to go back to Haiti because it's so bad there, he still feels tugged between the two countries, the cultures. He misses certain things, family there, and I have been through similar things. I moved here because I had a husband who wanted to live in the US. I wasn't all that excited about it, but I thought for a couple of years, it will be fun to have that experience. We never went back, and now we divorced, I have two sons who live here, and they have children, my grandchildren. So, my family is now here, and yet there are days that I still feel, after all these years, like an outsider, trying to assimilate, trying to look at things in what I think is the American way, the two-party political system, that kind of thing. Some food that I absolutely can't stand. Now and then, I cook some food that I ate when I was young and growing up in Europe, to resolve with that homesickness, things that you tried to resolve. So, I don't think it ever goes away. I just wonder how many people in the United States, it seems it's such a mixing of different people, different countries, all the people that are now trying to come to the United States and live here and work here. And all these people have this homesickness, this feeling tucked and pulled between two countries. It's different when you live in a country where you've grown up and everyone is from the same country, and generations have lived in the same country. So maybe that sort of resonated with me. It made me think about living in another country and adjusting. I thought for these students, when they felt sad, and I could very well understand it. That's the end of my story.",2,2
437,2004,"Well, let's continue about a sudden shift from late summer to fall that always catches me by surprise. We had some very nice warm days last week, and all of a sudden, boom, it's dark, it's rainy, the temperature is down. It really feels like fall. And none of the other seasons have this sudden change that really affects you. There's always a fall, always sort of affects me. I get melancholy, I get sad. The summer is over. We're looking at the long winter coming up, I just don't know why, yet our seasons don't do that. The end of winter into spring, it's not that sudden, it's a slow process. Sometimes the winter goes on and on into March and April, and the same from the spring into the summer. There is not this quick change, but September, when the fall date starts, there is a very sudden switch to fall-like weather, and it just tells you it's over. Put away those T-shirts and all that and get the sweaters out, so that it always makes me a bit sad. So I'm not sure I'll get over it, but I will adjust. But things about fall and winter and all that because of the seasons, I'm not all that different. You may not have it. So maybe I should move to a warmer climate or something, although I do like the seasons and I'm sure I will be enjoying the changing leaves in a couple of weeks and all that. I'm sure we will get some more warmer sunny days again, but these last couple of days, it really got me, and I have to get over it.",3,3
438,2005,"K. It's not a very interesting story today, but I have an issue with procrastination. When there are things that are just boring, unpleasant, things I just don't like to do, I tend to find a zillion things to do around the house or elsewhere. I'm outside the house and avoid doing what I really need to do. At times, it really bothers me. I need to have a call with my lawyer, nothing serious, that's a lot of paperwork to be filled out and all that. I just don't like these kinds of things. So guess what? I plan to call the lawyer today. What did I do? Instead, I cleaned out two closets, did some cleanup in the kitchen, did some shopping that I really didn't need to do, and on and on. When it's 5:00, I have not called the lawyer, so here we are. I wish I could do something about it. I'm sure I can, but it's a tendency I've been struggling with for many years, I must say. So I don't know what else I can add to it, but even though I was so busy today doing all these things, at the end of the day, I did not call the lawyer. I didn't feel good about that, I felt frustrated that again I let it slip. I'm frustrated. So I need to work on that, and that's sort of my story for today. Not very interesting, I know. I really know what I need to do as well, but I have the tendency, and I've had it for a long time. But that's it for today.",2,2
439,2015,"I'm going to talk about history and perceptions of people throughout history, just something I thought about today. I think it's very interesting how historical figures get surrounded by stories which might or might not be true, but still somehow seem to bring out their character and convey the traits they have. For example, Alexander the Great has many stories about him doing various things, many of them are probably not true and just apocrypha made up by people later, but they all serve to demonstrate what kind of a person Alexander was. I think that kind of story or those kind of stories help dictate how a person is remembered through history. In 100 years from now, there are probably stories about people who change the world today, many of them are probably not true, but that doesn't really matter because it's these stories that tell the future what these people were like and it's these stories that will inspire people in the future. I think that's quite interesting. Alexander is not the only example. First, I think one of the most famous examples is probably Jesus, but it's also true of many mathematicians. I connect to those stories because I want to become a mathematician too, and mathematicians love constructing apocrypha of famous mathematicians, especially Gauss, Galois, and people like that. If you look into history, the lives of these people are genuinely interesting, although they tend to get imbalanced over time. I don't think this is necessarily negative, even though it's not historically accurate. This ties into some broader thoughts I have about mythology and how much you can learn about our culture, our time, through their mythology, because mythology is always evolving, but the way it evolves reflects the society it's evolving in. Sometimes I wonder if myths are being changed even today and I wonder what the future will infer about us that even we don't know right now. Personally, it means that anything you do that will be remembered is going to be exaggerated and will interest people, especially if it's worth remembering. If you persevere through difficult times to achieve something great, people will exaggerate the trouble you went through, but that also means you'll be remembered for going through so many struggles. I just think it's very interesting how stories and history interact and how culture influences the stories being told at the time and how the future can look back through these stories to understand the past. And I wonder where I'll be in it someday, if anyone even remembers.",1,1
440,2016,"Cool, right? So, like I just said, a bunch of near things happened to me today. It's quite a weird day, so I'm just going to tell you about it. The first thing that happened to me today was, yes, I attended this literature class on J.R. Tolkien, and I've never really attended anything quite like it. And it was quite fun, talking about Tolkien and his wife and his work. Then later in the day, I went sailing for the first time. We learned how to rig, bolt, tie some knots, and things like that, so that was quite interesting. I do have to take a test before I can sail, though. Hopefully, that will go well. We'll see. So, that's another new thing. Finally, I had to deliver a lecture instead of a professor who felt sick today. I had to teach only 20 students about living rooms. Very scary, but it was also very rewarding at the same time. I'm glad I did it. Once the lecture went on, the students got more and more engaged in the material. It seemed like almost everyone was paying attention and many of them were actually actively participating, which is great. I can't really ask for much more. I think, especially in a math class, it's been an encouraging day.",2,2
441,2017,"Yeah, I've come to realize that many things I do are motivated by the fear of failure, which is a weird thing, or at least one of the most effective motivators for me, I think. The fear of failure is stronger than the draw of success and sometimes I can work insane amounts that I felt really impossible, are insanely effective, and surprised myself just because I wanted to avoid failing. And even conversely, sometimes I'm okay with not achieving the best I can, as long as I can avoid failure. Not sure if that's a good thing. I think it feels not correct because I think motivating myself to do something because I want to do it is probably better than only motivating myself to do something because if I don't, then I will fail in some sense. I think it's made worse by the fact that I tend to block out failures from my mind and yeah, not sure. I find it hard to recall experiences where I felt if I try hard, if I can, I definitely can't think of many, many instances where I failed. But they're always pushed to some back corner of my mind, and they rarely resurface, which again might not be a good thing because it can make me repeat mistakes. Yeah, so motivation is a weird thing. There are some things which I am doing purely intrinsically, not because of the fear of failure, and that's good. But those are also harder to keep up than things for which there's a possibility of failing and that sort of forces me to keep up. Sometimes I push my limits and makes me do things that I didn't realize I could, which is an interesting thing and maybe good in some ways, but otherwise always being pushed from behind by that certain negative forces probably not good. I'm not really sure what to do about it.",3,3
442,202,"A few months ago, I experienced what I know as the most fearful experience of my life. It was late in the evening and my body began to shake. Cold chills ran throughout my body and I lost control of my ability to breathe. My chest began pounding and I gasped for air. 

I called out to my partner, and suddenly he was there in front of me. I could not see him though, because my sight had been taken from me and my head began sweating. My partner grabbed me by the shoulders and began shaking me, and when that didn't work he lightly slapped my face. 

The chills made a change to heat and I broke out in a heated sweat. This was my first panic attack. It lasted no more than 15 minutes, but it felt like hours. My body was so weak after the fact and I could have sworn in that moment that I was going to die. 

My life seemed to flash before my eyes and all I could see was him. My partner, the love of my life, having to live a life without me in it. That is the day I realized that I had to go to therapy again. I made an appointment the very next day to seek help.",3,3
443,2027,"No, yeah. I think one story I have is just... I was thinking what to talk about, but the only thing which I haven't yet, I think, talked about is like with one of my friends from childhood. We've had, like a sort of, like a slow fall off where, I don't know, she expects me to do certain things or expects me to be in touch with her as much as she would like. But then, sometimes I'm not able to. I just need my own space in life, so that's always tricky. I feel like I don't really mind staying in touch with friends, but sometimes when someone expects you to, it just gets even more difficult. And it's not even like I don't want to stay in touch, it's just like sometimes I feel like her life is very complex. Most of the time, it just feels like a lot of emotional work. I don't know what to say to her, what to not say. Sometimes I think she thinks deeply and that makes me feel like I don't think deeply. It might also be just that, where I feel like whatever I'm doing is inadequate. Or sometimes she points things out, not things out which are not politically correct, but it seems which puts me off. Sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable, I think. Just good, like I learn through that, but then I don't know, it just doesn't make me feel comfortable. So, I've just been trying to see how to maintain that friendship, and also, we have known each other for such a long time. So, I do want to stay friends, but I think we'll have to just reinvent our friendship.",2,2
444,203,"A couple months ago my younger brother got married. I traveled back to my home town of St. Louis, Missouri for the event. I took my girlfriend along with me. It was her first trip to my home town ever. The trip started out great, we picked up our rental car and went to grab a pizza. 

The following day was my brother's wedding ceremony. We thought it had all been planned out thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody had checked the weather report. The day of the wedding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in late July. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen. We were all so optimistic about the big day. The ceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so it would start to cool down and allow for some reprieve from the heat of the day. In theory, that was a great idea. 

However, when my girlfriend and I pulled out of the driveway we noticed something new that we hadn't seen yet on the trip. Storm clouds moving in fast, and lots of them. Dark gray giants rose onto the horizon at a frightening pace. Lightning was visible in the distance as we began our drive to the wedding venue. We hoped and prayed that the storm would blow the other way, and that the outdoor wedding venue would be spared from this particular storm. Would we be able to get away with having the ceremony in decent weather? 

It became a race with time. As we drove to the wedding ceremony, it felt as though the clouds were following us and growing larger. As we arrived, I greeted my brother in the parking lot and asked if he thought it would rain. He said maybe, it depends how fast we can get this done. Everyone was present except for the minister, one of the few people who was completely essential to the process. 

As the minister arrived, it finally began to rain. It was raining on my brother's wedding day, I couldn't believe it, but luckily the ceremony was completed and we had a wonderful sunny reception the next day.",3,3
445,204,"A memorable event that occurred in the past 3 months was preparing my eldest child for kindergarten. I worked really hard over the summer helping her set a schedule and routine that would be similar to her school day. She worked on many activities in order to memorize her contact information, writing, reading, and being able to handle her emotional well-being. 

As summer began to end, she seemed a little nervous to leave me and her little sister. I realized that there was no way to remove that feeling from her. Instead, I made plans for us to do activities when she finishes her school day. Planning ahead allows for her to feel like her school day really isn't too long. 

When school first began, she was very tired from the long day. I didn't realize how much her schedule had affected her, so I introduced ""cuddle time"", which is pretty fun for her. 

The most important aspects of my child starting school have been numerous. I learned how important my role as mom is for my kids. I am their literal compass, and that responsibility goes beyond just sending them off to school. I try to understand how her day is going, and what obstacles she faces each day. I meditate on how I can be influential in her education when she gets home from school. 

I love this new journey that we are on, and am actively preparing myself for the next several years of her school career.",2,2
446,205,"Last weekend my husband and I came back from a trip together to Walt Disney World. We went without the kids and it was just the two of us. I was really excited because I love Disney and have a great time whenever I go there. 

The first day, we landed and went straight to a park. We went to Animal Kingdom and spend the entire day there. It was really hot, but I didn't care. We went on all the rides and had all the good snacks they had available in the park. 

The next day we went park hopping. We went to Epcot and the Magic Kingdom. 

The last day we went to Hollywood studios, which is my favorite of all the parks. I didn't want to leave. I feel like there is something magical about Disney and it makes me feel like a kid whenever I am there. 

I especially loved that it was just my husband and I there together. It was a lot more relaxed than when we take the kids along. We got to take our time and really enjoy everything. It was also nice spending time together, just him and I. We got to get away from everyday life and stress and reconnect. 

We shared romantic dinners and just enjoyed each others company away from it all. It was a memorable trip and I will never forget it.",3,3
447,206,"For 7 months we'd been saving for a family vacation. The first family vacation we'd taken as a family of four (plus the in-laws). We'd invited my in-laws to join us an extra set of eyes to help keep an eye on the girls while we went to the beach (you never know when one of them is going to want to run off and we didn't want anyone alone in or near the water). 

Not only was this our first family vacation as a family of four, but it was to the beach. The girls had never been to the beach before. We went to The Outer Banks, or OBX as the locals and annual visitors call it. We were so excited to see the expression on our 1 yr old and 2 yr old faces; would it be joy or even possibly fear that they'd express. 

Shockingly the girls aren't as much of a fan of the beach as their mother is. The response of our 2 yr old as she first stepped into the sand "" ew, yuck so dirty!"" was a laugh for all of us but it should have also been a sign as to how they would like or dislike the beach. What kid doesn't enjoy getting a little dirty or at least one would normally think. But not our girls. 

We didn't last more than 30 minutes building sand castles and standing on the sand as the waves washed over our feet. They'd talk about going to the beach but as soon as we'd get there, they'd be bored or tired of walking on the sand. 

Although the beach itself didn't go over as well as we'd anticipated, at least the girls enjoyed getting away and ""seeing"" the beach from a distance. And at least we got pictures we can look back at...however short the time was. And the memories....oh the memories we created were priceless. 

Our first family vacation may not have gone over as well as we anticipated, but we all had a great time relaxing and enjoying time together. That's what matters anyway.",2,2
448,207,"I work at a doctor's office and know all of the patients. I work with a lot of elderly people and I remember their names, their family, and things like that. One of my patients, whom I love dearly, has been getting sicker and sicker. She has been diagnosed with cancer and has not been responding to treatment well. Recently she has decided to stop with chemo and radiation because she doesn't want to spend the last few weeks of her life sick. It was a very hard decision for her to make, and for her family to accept. 

After she decided this, she came into the office and we talked about what we could do for her. When she was in she handed me a card and a small porcelain angel. She held my hand and told me she thought I was angel sent from heaven to help her during such an awful time. She said I gave her so much kindness and love, and that I felt more like family to her than a nurse. 

I felt my heart break into pieces, but also I felt so loved and appreciated. This woman was going through such a terrible time, and she wanted to comfort me. I hugged her and told her she was my family too, and that I love her very much. We held hands during her appointment, and I didn't want to let her go. 

Now I go see her on my days off and always bring flowers and some sweet tea. It's her favorite.",3,3
449,208,"This whole thing was special to me and something that had an impact because some of the people that came into town hadn't seen me since I was a kid. One person in particular was someone who really loved to play jokes on people and tease them. I have so many memories of them in particular picking on me. I really resented it as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected. 

As an adult, I know now that he was just a jokester and someone who loved pranks and joking around but as a kid, I saw it as torment and a bully. Nothing he did was even all that bad, just hiding and jump scaring everyone mostly. 

As an adult, it was the first time I had seen him in a long time and to be face to face with someone that I considered a bully growing up was so odd. Turns out, he was still joking around and kidding and being the same as I remembered him, but without the childlike thoughts of malice that I used to have. 

It really made an impact on me seeing him now with eyes that have grown and understood. I mentally forgave him for the pain he put me through as a kid. Some things latch on to you no matter what and being ""picked on"" for me was one of them. 

As an adult, I better understood things and seeing him do the same things he did to me (jump scaring, saying he was eating a cat when it was a regular burger, etc) seeing him do that to other kids, I see how it's harmless. 

It was a good case of when you are a kid, you can't understand anything. I felt a whole lot better after the situation. We ended up having a great talk about everything and I forgave him.",3,3
450,209,"In the beginning of June this year i found out that i was pregnant with my second baby,. My husband i have been trying to conceive for about a year and we finally did it. We were very excited! We had our first ultrasound when i was about 6 weeks pregnant, we saw our little bean and saw a heartbeat which is always such a relieve. 

For some reason i was very scared about miscarriage even though i've never had one, i'm still young and pretty healthy. But for some reason i kept googling the chances of miscarriage. 

A week later i had another ultrasound to measure baby on good equipment and there wasn't a heartbeat anymore. My little baby passed away... I was in denial. I thought it was a mistake, i couldn't process it. I had 2 more ultrasounds in 2 different clinics to confirm this horrible diagnose. My baby's heart stopped beating a couple of days after we saw a heartbeat. It was so heartbreaking. One of the worst experiences in my life. 

I miscarried 3 weeks later in the ER. I had a horrible postpartum depression and had suicidal thoughts. I was in a very dark place but God surrounded me with so much love. I feel much better now.",3,3
451,210,"I had been feeling pretty depressed lately, because I had been over-working myself. There wasn't much time in the day that I was taking to relax or reflect, and it was really starting to wear on me. I had just piled on more and more deadlines at work, thinking that I could do it all, but I was wrong. I was starting to get fatigued, and my work was suffering because of it. 

I was having an especially bad night, and I wanted to just give up, but I had a friend over who wouldn't let me. She told me that I needed to keep going, and basically that she believed in me, and in my ability to finish what I started. She told me that I was the hardest worker she knew, and that I was inspiring to her. She said that if I gave up, it would let her down, and that she knew I wouldn't let her down. 

That really helped, and it really touched me that she felt that way about me. It wasn't quite enough, though, as I was still very burned out. She told me to take the night off, and while I was relaxing, she went out and bought some things. She bought us some good food for dinner, as well as some nice wine to enjoy after. Then, she cooked me dinner, which was really good. 

After that, we just relaxed, listening to music and drinking wine, not having any care about work or deadlines. It was only one night, and it didn't solve the issue of being burned out, but it did give me some more fuel to keep on going and finish my projects. 

I am really thankful that she did that for me, and I am lucky to have her as a friend.",3,3
452,211,"I recently moved back to a big city to look for a job after a few years. After graduating grad school in this particular city I had moved upstate. However last month I packed my suitcase and came back to the same city to look for a job. I came back for a few reasons, one being better career opportunities but also to connect with my friends. 

I stayed over at a friend's apartment for a few weeks while trying to land job interviews. There I rediscovered our friendship from years ago. We both went to college together and it was heart warming that despite years of not really communicating other than facebook messaging we got a long pretty well. It was almost a comforting sign. It was like the universe showing me positive signs that I might be on the right path. 

For a few years I was unsure of where I should be. However coming back to the city and meeting with old friends showed me how much I felt at home here. Right now I am working a temporary job to hold me over. However I really pray that I will find something stable here and am able to live and work here again. 

Although the city has changed I still love it. Finally I realized this is where I want to be.",2,2
453,212,"Three months ago, my life completely changed for the better. I never thought the day would come where I would become a mother. At the age of thirty five and after years of trying to get pregnant and having two miscarriages, I had given up on having a child. My husband and I were looking into adopting but the process seemed pretty hard and there were no guarantees. 

In the end, I got pregnant out of no where and I was shocked to my core when I found out that I was pregnant and I was two months along. The fetus appeared healthy and I was on my way of becoming a mother. Three months ago, my daughter was born; a healthy 7 pound 3 oz. No one or nothing could have prepared me for the profound love I have for my daughter and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be a mother to my sweet girl. I love her so much and my husband and I are so very happy. We can't wait to see what the future holds and we are secretly hoping to be blessed with another child. 

The changes in our lives have been mostly positive and some negatives. The positives are having our child and being able to make life long memories with her. Our families have been great through out my pregnancy and they have been so helpful in the last couple of months. 

On the other hand, the negatives are not getting enough sleep. I feel tired and excited most of the time, and there are times when I doze off every chance I get. The worry for our child is horrible at times and its a major drawback for us because in the back of our mind we feel like this beautiful experience might not last and can be easily taken away from us.",3,3
454,213,"Two months ago I married the love of my life. It is by far the most memorable day of my life. We met in high school, became teen parents, and had been dating for a little over 14 years. We had a long 5 year engagement, just to ensure that our wedding day was perfect. We paid for everything and planned everything on our own, which I think adds to the memory of our special day. We both had input and we tailored our decisions to stay true to our love story, as well as highlighting our very different personalities. 

It was a great day and when we read our vows, people cried. We had a very intimate setting, very close friends and family only, and I think it made it that much more special. We really just focused on ourselves and each other, something a lot of couples forget to do. 

I've heard so many times, from friends and family, that they wish they could go back and do it all over again. I've heard a lot of stories about how the day flew by and that they never took the time to actually enjoy it. A lot of people regret the decisions they make when it comes to their wedding day. They wish they would have had a smaller or a less expensive wedding. A lot of my friends and family believe they wasted a large sum of money on one single day and ended up being in debt afterwards. 

We took all of those stories and we decided to not let that be our story. We bought everything with cash, nothing as a loan or on credit. We made our own smorgasbord of food and desserts. We treated it like Thanksgiving. It was awesome and delicious. We worried less about being flashy and classy and more about being comfortable and memorable. We wore what we wanted and didn't have a dress code for our guests. There was no rehearsal dinner, no huge reception. We told people to come as you are and bring their own drinks. 

Everyone really enjoyed just relaxing, eating good food, and letting loose. It was beautiful, laid back and there's nothing I would change about our special day.",2,2
455,214,"I ventured into work like any other day. I was tired and fed up with the conditions of my work environment and pay on top of that. On this day, I planned on spending my entire evening looking for another job. 

Around lunch time I was called in for a random meeting. I figured I was somehow in trouble for something. Turns out, it was completely opposite of what I had expected. My superior sat me down and he had a stack of papers in his hand. It was a contract stating my terms of employment would be changing if I agreed. My title was being changed along with my pay rate. I was just stunned, because I felt like my hard work was often dismissed and not even recognized. 

After going through this contract, I signed my name, thanked my superior, and nearly skipped out of this conference room. My new pay rate would take effect in my next pay check. It was a fairly significant increase, so I was excited to see what kind of checks I would be making now. 

With my promotion, came a new office as well. Overall it was a good day. Very unexpected, but in the end I was appreciative my hard work had finally been recognized.",2,2
456,215,"Today was one of the saddest days of my life. It started early in the day, and my parents came by and picked me up at my house. Everyone was in a very somber mood, but it was sunny and quite warm. We drove out to a church about thirty minutes away near where my mom grew up, and while driving I couldn't help but think back to all the good memories I had with my cousin. She was always so happy and nice and just fun to be around. But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the memories that were going over in my mind. 

Arriving at the church and seeing all of my family, it was hard. It was just so sad, all of it. Seeing my aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knew then that she was strong and was going to be able to get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, so he was able to help with the service and I think that helped ease some of the pain. 

After the service we all went to the cemetery and gathered up on the hill in the shade. Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, I started to cry much harder than I had been all day at that point. All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back, made me very sad, and made me miss her dearly. 

We then all met at a local place where they served a late lunch and we had some drinks. It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason. 

I didn't really know how to feel when we left and I made it back home. I was deeply saddened, and just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins felt. I know that life had changed for them forever, and now life was starting again without their dear one, and that hurt me again. But my family is strong, and stronger together, and I know we will get through this like we will any other tragedy that comes our way.",3,3
457,216,"I was in a 5 year relationship with a woman who lived in another country. When we decided to be together, I remember like it was yesterday. Getting my passport, and buying the plane ticket seemed small in the entire thing. What was really the big deal was getting on an airplane for the very first time. Being afraid of flying made this hard enough, but the excitement of going to another country on the other side of the world to meet the woman I loved overcame all of it. 

She and I made plans to meet up at the airport when I arrived, and what we where going to do. When I got there, departed the plane, went through immigration, and got my belongings she was no where to be seen. I waited for several hours outside the airport, trying to call her phone. When she finally answered, she told me she could not come to the airport. She asked me to just get a hotel and she would see me the next day. 

I was left in a foreign country alone I had no idea about, holding flowers and chocolates I brought for her. Looking foolish, I then decided to just get a taxi to a nice hotel for the night to relax from the jet lag, and decide what to do from there. 

The next morning, she called me. She said she could not meet me that day either, maybe the next day she could. Her family called me, randomly, and said out of respect for me going all the way there they felt it was the right thing to do to tell me my girlfriend of 5 years had another boyfriend, and was pregnant. That she had been scamming me the entire time.",3,3
458,217,"My wife and I had been teaching my son how to ride his bike for quite a while. He was having trouble learning. We started out with the traditional style of the parent holding the seat and the handlebars while the child pedals. We ran several days of trials this way. It was hard for my son to realize the mechanics. 

I would hold the seat and he would begin to lean into me. He wouldn't try to adjust himself, but would rely on me to keep him upright. It wasn't working. 

I looked online for some suggestions. This was a first for both my wife and I. I found one post advising to have the child sit on the seat and walk the bike themselves, then when they have enough momentum, start pedaling. 

This method made total sense to me. It seemed to teach them the natural motions while still being safe. My son tried this method a few times. He was starting to get the balance down that he needed. 

He finally walked it out and began to pedal. He went the length of the driveway and now he is a full-fledged bike rider. It was one of the proudest moments of my life.",2,2
459,218,"The most recent memorable event was learning that my mom has a personality disorder call Narcissist Personality Disorder. It explained so much of my youth and adult life living with her and interacting with her. 

 

My siblings and I were never encouraged to be together, to congratulate each other, to help each other by her. We were only told of the negative things that each one had supposedly done and that we all had some type of grudge against each other. Therefore we all grew apart and did not trust each other. We were not a close family or even a fake family. We all basically just knew of each other. 

 

Learning that she has the disorder put a lot into perspective but does not allow for resolution or closure with her. Even with her diagnosis she does not admit anything. She still wants to be the ""pit stop"" among the children. 

 

Unfortunately, I see the same pattern in my siblings and myself. At this point I cannot communicate with her. She has a great burden about me from my childhood that she has not yet acknowledged. So I am always in her mind trying to retaliate. She tells this to the family and they do not know which is truth and have chosen to believe her. 

 

I am leaving them and her alone as it will do no good until someone else is on the receiving end of the vitriol.",3,3
460,220,"I went to a nearby city to meet up with family members for a very memorable family reunion. There were about 12 of us in all. We went out to dinner at a very nice Chinese restaurant. 

My brother, who is a math professor, is very precise in his language. He requires precision from everyone around him. He started asking a lot of questions about the food options. 

The waiter became offended, even though there was nothing offensive about the questions. But the waiter didn't like my brother's tone of voice. At one point he stepped back and said ""I don't need to be talked to like that."" 

It was kind of sad. I realized that my brother has no idea how he comes off when he's in professorial mode. My brother ended up getting something he didn't really love, because he felt bad about what happened, and had decided to stop asking questions. 

In the end, the food was good, the company was good, the moment was forgotten, and the waiter got a pretty nice tip. And it was good to see my brother. We had an excellent rest of the reunion. I'm probably the only one who still recalls the moment.",2,2
461,221,"In July I went to rehab. My husband and I had been fighting about finances a lot and my absences from work. For years I had been telling myself that I would quit drinking and quit smoking cannabis, but every day I would tell myself I would start tomorrow. I realized I couldn't do it on my own so I made the call, was accepted into a program to start the next day, and after a restless night I set off to rehab. I bought a pack of cigarettes on the way there, my first in nearly three years. 

I was so nervous as I sat in the lobby waiting to be called. What would the days look like? Would I be taken seriously since my addiction was to a substance everyone says you can't get addicted to? What would the others be like? Would I be the youngest or the oldest? Finally my name was called and I spent the next few hours signing paperwork, paying for treatment up front, and meeting with a medical professional. 

I was told to strip and put on scrubs, though the pair of pants they tried to give me were much too small, and I laughed for the first time that day when they hardly slid over my knees. I was able to keep my own sweatpants, but the horrid green scrub shirt made me feel like the inmates I've seen on tv. 

Eventually they dropped me off down in the kitchen where a group of people were playing Cards Against Humanity. I didn't know what the plan was for the rest of the evening but that half hour spent watching these people laugh gave me some time to get my bearings. I heard names and tried to match them with faces. I saw two others in scrubs and realized it was their first day too. Some faces were happy; others looks tired, worn down, half asleep. 

Dinner was challenging because I don't eat animal products and usually had the assistance of marijuana to quell the nausea. The nurse offered me Ativan but I refused; I asked her for some when I threw up some sad lettuce and yellow rice a few minutes later. 

During one of the cigarette breaks I familiarized myself with the others there and was convinced to sign up for a yoga class. The class was relaxing, but I cried the whole time. I was so scared, for myself, for my husband, for the future. 

When it was all said and done I went into my room, lay down on the small twin mattress with the plastic cover, and cried myself to sleep.",3,3
462,223,"I know it may sound silly but it was quite emotional to finish what I now consider to be my favorite book. It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters. I am also a Texan. 

Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure. This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well). There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own. The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book. 

Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them. He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't ""War and Peace"" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it. 

I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove. It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend. I wondered what I was going to do for reading next. I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry. I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove. 

Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book. As such the others paled in comparison.",3,3
463,224,"About two months ago, my family and I went to the beach in California. There was a beach volleyball tournament that we wanted to see. We got up early in the day and were already at the beach around 10 am. We swam, sunbathed, and hung out while we waited for the tournament to start. The weather was perfect and it felt great that my family was together for the whole day. I got to catch up with my siblings since I had not seen them in a while. 

Then, the tournament started and we nervously and anxiously watched and cheered on our favorite team. The team ended up winning and we were so excited. Around 8pm we started packing up and walking home. 

When we got home, we realized we all got very badly sunburned. I guess in the excitement of it all, we forgot to reapply sunscreen throughout the day. We immediately went to the drugstore to get some aloe vera and pain killers. My brothers filled up the bathtub with a bunch of ice and soaked in it. We all got sunburned in the past, but never this badly. 

It was interesting to see how much we all helped each other. My brothers were wetting towels for everyone, and mom was making sure we were staying hydrated. I was in charge of the aloe and my dad was entertaining us to distract us. 

We had plans to go to dinner that night, we even made reservations. We all wanted to go so we started getting ready, but even the clothes were painful on our skin. Since we would all probably be cranky, we decided it is best to just cancel dinner and stay in. 

That day was so memorable to me because it started out as the best day I had in a long time, but then it ended with my whole family in excruciating pain. Despite everything this day brought us all together as a family and I am so happy it did.",3,3
464,225,"I can remember and think a lot about a trip I took with my husband to the Bahamas! It was a wonderful and relaxing trip for both of us. We flew to Miami and then a short flight to the Bahamas. We took a taxi to the huge hotel we were staying at. On the way, I could see a lighthouse and clear blue water. We both felt so good to be there. The weather was perfect with a warm breeze and full sun! 

After getting our room near the pool and beach area, we went straight away and got lunch and walked around the area. It had many restaurants, gambling areas, pools, beaches, water sports, shopping, exercise rooms, massage rooms and dinner entertainment! Everyday we had things to do and see. 

There were many memorable things I did there, like going down a huge slide with my husband behind me at once. Getting my hair braided on the white sand with two lovely ladies with a drink in my hand having interesting conversation. It was fun to pick out beads for my hair. 

I think one of the most memorable was when my husband took me to the Columbia Emerald store and helped me pick out a ring I like for a memory of the trip. It is a beautiful emerald ring in gold with an oval shaped emerald in the middle and smaller ones on both sides. Everyday I wear the ring and its makes me so happy to remember all the fun times we had there. 

Needless to say we want to go back. Its a great place to visit and relax. Spending time with the one you love is the best!",2,2
465,226,"This story is about my family's recent vacation to Myrtle Beach, and the subsequent heart attack my wife's father suffered while there. We had planned a week long vacation to the beach, travelling from Ohio in order to spend time with my family, including my parents and brother, and my wife's parents, and our 2 children. 

After having fun for 4 days, my father in law awoke Thursday morning complaining of some pain in his jaw and heartburn. My father in law and his wife felt that they should conservatively go to the hospital to get checked out. Unfortunately, a blood test returned with slightly elevated enzyme numbers, meaning some minor heart damage may have occurred. No problem, we thought, just a few more tests and a ruined day of vacation. 

Well, after heart catheter, the really bad news came in. My father in law would need quadruple bypass surgery immediately. They scheduled him for surgery Monday morning, and he would have to stay in Myrtle Beach for another few weeks after the surgery until he was allowed to fly home. 

What I will remember the most is visiting my father in law on Friday morning at the hospital and letting him visit with his grandchildren. He was so stone faced and obviously scared and in mental anguish. I gave him a hug goodbye, since I had to drive my kids home on Saturday, and he was in tears. It was very painful to witness that. 

Fortunately, my wife was going to stay with her mom and dad for a few more days to get through the surgery and help any way she could. In excellent news, my father in law had a perfect surgery and is now recovering and getting stronger every day. 

The whole sequence of events is a good reminder to take life one day at a time, and appreciate all that we are given. Hopefully we have many more years of his presence to make many more memories.",3,3
466,227,"It was the day that I met my husband. He came into my life and affected me in so many ways and for which I really do not have words to describe. Yet, I will try my best to portray how his coming into my life completely changed me and gave me a whole new world to look at. 

One of the things that I noticed immediately when I met my husband was how safe and secure he made me feel. I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. 

He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. 

Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. 

This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound.",3,3
467,228,"Sarah got the job in Amsterdam. She's really excited, and I'm happy for her, but I'm worried too. I know the doctors say her tumor is not aggressive, and that her situation is good, but it's still cancer. Amsterdam has excellent health care options, but her doctors here are very good and know her case. She says it's not a big deal and that she'll still be doing a lot of her tests when she flies back here, but still. 

The insurance situation is complicated, too. She says her company deals with this sort of thing all the time, and that they know what to do, but there's a difference between someone who's insurance is just in case and her situation. She can't afford any lapses or mistakes, and I'm not convinced everything will work out as smoothly as she thinks. 

Still, she's incredibly excited, and this does seem like a great opportunity for her. It's not my place to tell her what she can and can't do, so all I can do is be supportive and try to make sure she's doing everything she can to stay healthy. Not that she needs much help, she's been incredibly motivated not to let this thing stop her. That's probably part of why she's so all-in about this job. 

At least, for the first time in her life, she's moving and I don't have to help. Her company is taking care of everything, and except for one chair that I grudgingly agreed to store for her I don't have to lift a finger. She may or may not get the chair back. 

I hope I look back on this entry and see it as the start of good things and me being too protective. I'm still worried, though.",3,3
468,229,"Last Friday night, one of our dogs attacked the other dog. We have two dogs. One is a hound mix around 60 pounds, Roxy. Our other dog is a terrier mix around 30 pounds, Sadie, and she has a seizure disorder. They both recently just turned three and have spent the majority of their lives together. We adopted Sadie at three months, and Roxy at six months. 

Sadie developed a seizure disorder and would have seizures at night about once a month, and they are cluster seizures so they happen a few times within a 24-hour period. Roxy usually sleeps in her kennel downstairs at night so she hasn't been around the seizures. Starting six months ago, Sadie's seizures have progressed and happen every two weeks now and during the day as well. Starting six months ago, Roxy would attack Sadie during her seizures. 

We thought at first she was trying to help, but then it got worse. Last Friday night, everything seemed fine and it was gorgeous weather outside so we took the dogs for a walk. Roxy attacked Sadie in the woods behind our house even though Sadie was not having a seizure. Sadie is doing okay, we took her to the vet on Monday when they opened and she got some shots and cleaned up. 

We don't know what to do with Roxy though. Most likely we will have to put her down. I'm so upset and disturbed, this is one of the most difficult things I've ever done. I love them both to pieces. I wish I could re-home Roxy but we don't know anyone who can take her and our vet said she will probably be put down at a shelter. It's just an ugly and very unpleasant situation. 

We started Roxy on an antidepressant on Monday to help take the edge off of her aggression but then we will be boarding her for 14 days at a training facility. I really truly want everything to work out and for everyone to be okay.",3,3
469,230,"Four months ago, I gave birth to my second child, a beautiful baby girl. My husband and I were anxiously waiting for the day to arrive. We were well prepared, prepped, and ready to go at a moments notice. When we arrived at the hospital, we were overcome with nerves and excitement. Things were taking a different route than they had with the birth of my son, so we did not know what to expect. Over the course of a day, we were well taken care of by the nurses and staff at the hospital and they helped move things along. 

When it came to the birth of my daughter, it all happened so fast! My husband and I were overjoyed to meet her. It is an experience like no other. Our small family of three quickly became a wonderful family of four. We were able to enjoy some precious time of just the three of us before her big brother came to meet her. 

I was feeling so happy with the arrival of our new baby, but also feeling anxious about my son meeting his new sister. It had been just him for 3 years, I was unsure how he was going to take to this new being entering his life. The past four months have been a learning experience for all of us. I am so excited with the bond my children are forming and with how our family is together. Things feel complete; we are all happy and healthy and that's all that matters.",3,3
470,231,"Kich died in April. Kich was my cat, but having been his caretaker for 17 years, he was my family through and through. I have never bonded as closely with a human as I did with him. He almost died when I found him at 4 months with parasites, and then again at age 6. His health began to fail and there was nothing that could be done. 

Taking him in to be euthanized and going through the process with him was surreal. I held him so close and so tight. I was terrified when they took him away to sedate him and frantic when they brought him back limp. I truly saw how fragile life is, how it can drain away over time and then gently release, and that there's nothing that can be done to stop it or bring it back. 

Kich's death is so painful to deal with and I miss him terribly, but there is one thing that makes it all ok. Nothing can hurt him again. He no longer suffers. As I walked home, I felt physically light because of this fact. I felt such extreme peace even in my grief. I'm so glad my little buddy is finally free.",3,3
471,232,"I recently moved to California. Moving to California was a really difficult decision. I'd lived in Washington DC for the last 10 years, and all my friends and family are there, or on the East Coast. I originally moved to Malibu, and, though it was beautiful, I felt isolated and really missed my friends and family. I was really surprised at how unhappy I felt. 

Then I moved to West Hollywood and was closer to some of the friends I had made in college who lived out there. Though the weather was beautiful, I often felt lonely. A few months ago I joined a MeetUp group for new people living in LA. Through it I've made some really great friends, and really realize how important connection is in life. 

I've come to realize that it really isn't where you live that makes a person happy, it is the people you're with. I've since also reconnected with friends I'd lost contact with from college, and even from high school. Now that I have friends out here, I feel so much happier, and am able to enjoy the great weather and the beach. 

Though I miss my friends on the East Coast tremendously, I don't think I could ever move back. This was a huge life change, but it was always a dream to live in California. I'm proud of myself for making this dream come true.",3,3
472,233,"I recently moved to Houston, TX from Denver, CO to be with my now girlfriend. It was overall a very nerve wracking experience and I was very unsure how everything would play out. Suffice to say, I was taking a big risk. I think that it was a really difficult thing to do, but I wanted to do it because it was something I believed in. 

I was nervous the entire time. I took an uber to the train station in Downtown Denver and then the train to the airport. I was several hours early, but I had to wait forever because there were so many people flying that day. It took about 2 hours to get through TSA and to my terminal. I then tried everything I could to stay calm until my plane. 

It was delayed by a couple of hours and we didn't end up flying until around 9PM. I landed at 11AM, and was ecstatic to see my girlfriend. We got my luggage and left. I felt like the journey was finally over and I'm glad I made the decision I did. 

We drove to her house and on the way got Whataburger, which was delicious. I had never had it before.",3,3
473,234,"For my birthday my husband purchased tickets to see Paul McCartney in concert in June. I have always been a Beatles fan and Paul is my absolute favorite. My husband is not a rock music fan so this gesture was truly meaningful me as I knew he would go to the concert, but it may not be his favorite way to spend an evening. We also lost part of our income last year so this was truly a splurge for us. 

When the evening finally came we found babysitters for our kids and made the trip across town for dinner and then to the show. It was our first time visiting this particular venue so it was definitely an adventure getting there and figuring out parking. We had gotten there early so we had a chance to just sit and relax before the concert started. And then there was about a 30 minute delay to the actual concert. 

Once the concert started though I knew that everything we had gone through to get there had been worth it. I'm not too proud to say that I teared up when Paul took the stage. He sang a lot of my favorites and the stage was lit up with images of him with the Beatles, Wings, and his later solo career. There was even a huge fireworks display that shook the entire stadium. I clapped, yelled, and sang along and my husband also seemed to have a great time. 

This might have been the best birthday present ever. It was definitely a night I won't ever forget.",3,3
474,235,"Recently, I went to my very first baseball game. Since I didn't grow up in the US, baseball was not a big part of my childhood. I went with my boyfriend and 3 of our friends. Since we wanted to see the Chicago Cubs vs the San Francisco Giants, we had to drive to Chicago to go to Wrigley field. It took us about 2 and a half hours to get there but it didn't feel like a long drive at all. We had rented out an Airbnb which was really comfortable. 

Once we got there, we ordered some Chicago deep-dish pizza at Lou Malnati's before heading to the game. We took a Lyft to the game and walking up to the field was very exciting. I didn't know that Wrigley Field is a historic baseball field but it is. 

Once inside, it was exactly like the movies show it to be. All the concessions and vendors and seating looked familiar because of the American media. We got there after the game had already started and the Cubs had the lead. I am not very proficient at baseball rules so I had a tough time fully following the game but it was fun regardless. There were some traditions I didn't know about, like the 7th inning stretch when everyone sang 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game'. 

The Cubs won and all of the locals were very excited. We ended the night by going out to a bar across the street and dancing.",1,1
475,236,"At the end of May 2019 myself and my family went on Vacation to the Smoky Mountains. It was the first time my children had ever been. We took them to DollyWood and my 8 year old daughter was finally able to ride the ""big rides"" at an amusement park. She was ecstatic! 

We also went to SplahCountry, which both of the kids thoroughly enjoyed. My sister and her family and my parents were also on the trip with us. We had a cabin for all of us that included an indoor pool, hot tub, game room, theater room, and a pool table. I have a nephew and 2 nieces, and all of the kids (including mine) shared a room with bunk beds. The kids had a blast. 

My son's favorite part was when we visited Goats on the Roof and he rode the Alpine Coaster. My daughter loved going to the Hatfield and McCoy Dinner Show. We sat in the Splash Zone and she even was called up on stage! She was very excited to be able to go up on stage. After the show we were able to purchase a copy of our show, so we will always have the memory of her being a part of it. 

I love being able to spend time with my family and see my children experience new things.",2,2
476,237,"My best friend in the world hit me during a fight a couple of months ago. It was an open-handed, angry slap on the face. Followed by frozen shared-shock. 

It all started when we were arguing over who should be doing what tasks around the apartment. I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. 

But when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. 

It would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. 

Well one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. 

She was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. 

It's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken. I just hope that one day we can get past this, because it breaks my heart that such a stupid beginning of a fight has ended in more serious sadness.",3,3
477,240,"A good friend of mine recently died in a car accident. Attending his funeral was very emotional. I was in tears the whole time I was in the room with his body. It was so incredibly unfair to me that this funny, kind, gentle human being was dead at only age 37. He had only just gotten married two years ago. That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver. 

It made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, ""I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?"" which only made me more mad. 

Although I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing. 

Later on his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech. I felt glad I could support her. It also made me think about how when I die I want a happy, positive, and small funeral.",3,3
478,241,"I made my girlfriend angry a few days ago. She ended up sending me a torrent of verbally abusive messages. Not wanting to deal with this treatment so late in the night I stopped reading them. The next morning they sent a message apologizing for their behavior. I took some time to take care of myself and accepted her apology a few hours later. 

Our conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. 

What ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. 

In the end she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse. Since then, I have slowly grown to lose my feelings towards her. I will likely break up with her the next time this happens.",3,3
479,242,"My wife and kids were going on vacation that I unfortunately could not go on. This vacation had been planned since the month they had gotten back from the vacation the year before. She was to spend a week out out of town with the kids visiting family. I had mentioned cooking bbq to send with her this year. I love bbq. Throughout the year I will have a few big cookouts, have people over to eat and have drinks and will generally share with neighbors as well. 

So the day before she left, I woke up at 4am and fired up our big offset cooker (the smoker) and prepped roughly 30 lbs of meat. I threw the meat on and tended to the fire all day all while she ran around took care of any last minute errands she needed to take care of before leaving. The meat hit its plateau, one of the longest I had experienced in my roughly 20 years of cooking bbq. Stressed because even when these were finished we still had work to do. 

At around 10pm they finished, we pulled them and let them rest. We then quickly shredded, and vacuum sealed all the meat for her trip. She leaves on her trip. We talk occasionally but no mention of the bbq. 

Day 2 passes, still haven't heard anything about the barbecue I sent. I just assumed it would be a few people and a maybe a small dinner get together and they would probably enjoy it. On day three I received some pictures of some tables and a tent setup with my bbq on display. They had invited everybody. At this point I am concerned. Is this type of bbq everyone's cup of tea? 

Apparently so, as I received a picture of groups of people eating and having a good time. My wife called and said it was a huge success, some even had as many three to four pulled pork sandwiches, she explained that people who didn't even plan on coming showed up to eat after they heard about the bbq. It was a hit and they all thanked me. It felt good to know it was a success. My hard work paid off.",2,2
480,243,"Well I would have to say the most recent event that has made a huge impact on my life is TS Imelda. We didn’t expect this storm to be what it was so we were not prepared. The rain fell for the whole day and we slowly watched the water rising. When it got to about ankle high we went ahead & moved the vehicles to higher ground(we learned our lesson from Harvey). We went back to the house & started lifting everything ground level up. 

After about 4 hours water started coming in the house. We grabbed some bags & our dog in the husband's truck & went down the road to a friend's house. The next day we went back down to see the damage that was done. It wasn’t anywhere what Harvey was(we got 3 feet of water)but just enough to soak all the carpets & floors probably an inch of water. 

So we called our insurance companies immediately they were out the next day. That didn’t turn out like I thought it would it has been a tedious process. First off they want pictures from before Harvey & after Harvey to prove the work we had done after the last store plus all the receipts. Then they want the pictures of the house now & as the work is being done this time. 

Then we are stuck staying with friends who we love but two families can not live together for very long without tempers flaring. It’s been about a month & they're finally done with the house repairs. So we’re hoping to be back in our house by this week.",2,2
481,245,"I have been unemployed for approximately 6 months. I sprained my ankle at work and I have been laid off from the job. In the spring, April 2019, my unemployment compensation will run out. I have been applying for jobs and interviewing, but could not find anything. I was really getting discouraged. I have health issues and some jobs I just can't do anymore. I am unable to stand on my feet for long periods of time. That cut out a lot of jobs. 

One evening, my son called me and told me he had seen a job in the newspaper and thought I should call. It was an office manager job at the sewer plant in the small town my parents live in. I knew the people who worked there and the person doing the hiring. I called him immediately and he wanted to me to send him my information. He said he thought I would be perfect for the job. 

I met with him the next week and was offered the job. I was so happy. The job is only part-time, but that works great for me. I am able to work in the mornings and go to doctor or physical therapy appointments in the afternoons. 

I am so excited to start this job. I will be the office manager. I know I will have a lot to learn, but I am so looking forward to it. I hope this is the start for a better future for me. I will be doing the work I like and I will be able to do it without putting more strain on my body.",2,2
482,246,"I was homeless for 9 years in Hawaii because of the president during that time was trying to extort money from military families to fund his campaign about going to war against another country. I remember when I was 8 years old, seeing the Sheriff at our front door saying that we were going to be escorted out of our government house due to the fact that we were unable to make the money within the week to give them. At the time I didn't know what this meant because I was so young. 

After we began to move out of our house, Reality began to make sense and the danger of the unknown future was beginning to weigh down upon the center of my consciousness. I grew up homeless, losing everything that I ever owned over a weekend changed the way that I think and see things. I grew up in homeless shelters, living in the back of a car with my brother, sister, and mother who was at the time very frustrated with the way things were going, I didn't blame her. 

My mom never made good decisions afterwards. She picked the wrong people to trust and those people always took advantage of us. Those who were supposed to be apart of the Christian society are the most wicked people I have ever lived with. Taking the little money we had and abusing my mom in front of me makes me want to hunt them down and treat them in a similar way. I will not forgive them, nor forget them. 

Years have passed now, My mom is dead. She died on the Fourth of July. She endured all of that abuse just to die a few years later. I am alone now. I have no real family left. 

I am attending Job Corps which I am now hearing are being shut down throughout the country by another man that says he does it for the ""Good of the Country"". I have no bad feelings towards the present president, but I hope that he doesn't make another decision like the past president that will affect so many in the most unfortunate ways. 

They say America is the greatest country, I don't see that any more. Its the greediest.",3,3
483,247,"The day was perfect. Off to the Island, Mackinac that is. We both lived in the area for thirty years and had not ever visited the island even though it was less than an hour a way. My wife and I had talked for years of visiting the Island. Now off we went. The ferry ride over was a little rough I was concerned because my wife did not like boats. 

The first thing I noticed about the Island was it smelled of horse crap. The next I noticed was the people. There were bicycles whipping between the horses and the people. 

The first thing we did was get tickets to the butterfly house. Then we trekked to the top of a huge hill to see the Fort. After the Fort the butterfly house. There were thousands of live Butterflies everywhere. 

After this we were both tired, only there for and hour and are legs felt like rubber. Fate was with us and we existed the house there was a horse taxi right there. So off to the Grand Hotel. A nice place but disappointing in the fact they charge people ten dollars just to walk on the grounds. 

Off to eat after that then shopping. My wife surprised me by not buying much of anything until we reached a shop that took Western Picture of you dressed in Western garb. This was something she always wanted. So I dressed up as a cowboy and she as a bar wench and we had our picture. This thrilled her which thrilled me as well. 

All in all the trip will be something we always remember. And we have a picture to prove it.",2,2
484,248,"About 6 months ago I was on a dating app just trying to kill time. I was going trough a hard time in my life and I was very depressed. Suddenly, a person started talking to me, telling me that I look sad in my profile picture. After speaking for a while we decided to meet. I thought nothing of this meeting, I simply made of it as another one night stand, but when I saw the person. He was more good looking than the pictures, he had a killing smiling and a very cheery and bright personality. 

I was very nervous and I feared that he might not like me, or that I wasn't good enough for him. After meeting several times, our relationship has grown stronger and stronger. The most memorable thing is that even one time when I told him my real age, since I look way younger than I am. He seemed a little thrown back by this and I told him maybe it was time for us to end this relationship. 

After a week he texted me saying he still wanted to talk to me and now we are communicating everyday and we have a strong relationship. This experience has showed to me that there are people who deeply care about me, and that I am a desirable person. Not just for one night stands, but for relationships too. My confidence has greatly expanded thanks to this encounter. 

I hope our relationship lasts a long time.",3,3
485,250,"I recently took one of the best trips of my life. I went on vacation this summer to NYC. I have always wanted to travel to New York. I have had dreams of going there since I was a little kid. I majored in finance in college so seeing the biggest financial district in the world was incredible. I went on a tour of wall street and took a picture with the infamous bull. 

There are so many things to do in NYC and my best friend and I made the most of our time. We went on a ferry ride to go see the Statue of Liberty. We went and saw the memorial for the twin towers. One of my favorite moments was when we went to a rooftop bar and were hanging out with a perfect view of the sky-line. 

The only negative thing about NYC is the prices. It was like $15 for a cocktail. I knew it would be expensive there but it was crazy. Another plus about the city is that there is world-class dining pretty much everywhere you go. You could eat world-class dining or you could get a hot dog from a cart and either way the food was delicious. 

If it wasn't so expensive to live there I would definitely want to move. The city life is for me.",2,2
486,252,"Approximately 6 months ago, I started feeling emotionally numb. I did not feel highs or low just burned out. I tried ignoring it for a while, however it eventually lead to all the emotions coming back all at once. This caused me to hyper ventilate and have a panic attack. I have only had 1 or 2 panic attacks previously in my entire life, so this was very out of the ordinary. 

I was in my living room when this happened and my wife immediately started helping. She asked me to name 5 objects around the room, then 5 colors. This helped me focus and get myself back under control. 

This was a triggering event to make me realize I needed to stop ignoring my mental health issues and seek help. So with the encouragement of my wife, I went to see my family Doctor. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. 

My family doctor recommended medication, which was also a trigger for me, as I had a lot of misconceptions about taking medication for mental health. I felt like it would make me weak. I did eventually try the medication and it helped me immensely. All my physiological reactions went away. 

I also decided that day to seek out therapy.",3,3
487,254,"I was having a hard time finding work or how to make money about 5 months ago. I was getting desperate and was starting to sell my personal items that I really cherished. When my friend found out what was happening he offered to lend me his work van and get me a job where he worked. He bought all the supplies I would need to start the job, gave me money for gas, and even bought my meals for a few weeks. I had never done anything like this for him. It really shocked me how willing he was to help me, nobody had offered anything like this to me before.

He really helped me out and allowed me to use the money I made on all the bills I had backed up. If it wasn't for his kindness I would have been without a place to live or a way to continue to live there. He never asked for anything back either, he jut wanted me to get back on to my feet. 

He did all the training himself so I wouldn't feel uncomfortable with somebody I didn't know. He even went to bat for me with the boss when they tried to take advantage of me because I was the new worker. Even when I got injured on the job he made sure that they treated me right and that I got the treatment that I needed. 

When I finally saved up money and got my bills paid down I offered to start paying him for some of the things he did. He just told me to keep it and make sure I don't get in that situation again. 

Ever since then he has done everything to help me, and I possibly wouldn't be here today without his kindness towards me.",3,3
488,256,"The thing that comes to mind of something memorable in the last six months would be my brother getting married. My brother and I have been close since I can remember. Life has lead us in different directions and caused us to distant because of his relocation for work. I still feel like he is one of the only people who know me best. So when he asked me to be the best man in his wedding, I was honored. 

We all gathered before the wedding party just the groom and groomsmen because of the bad luck seeing your spouse and all. We were getting ready and chatting when we suddenly realized one of the groomsman who was one of my brothers friends was not with us. One at time we started calling him on his cell phone. We called and called for around a half hour. The wedding was going to begin in about another hour and a half. 

We decided to go looking for my brother's friend/groomsman because we had seen him earlier that day. In fact he was with us when entered the facility the wedding was taking place at. We decided that maybe his phone was dead and we should go search for him. So me and cousin who was also a groomsmen went to look for him. We looked and looked but didnt have any luck. After half an hour we went back to tell my brother we couldnt find him. 

With about an hour left until wedding things became panicky. About 20 minutes later of chaos and panic we got a call from housekeeping. My brothers friend who is almost 30 years old was passed out drunk in the closet where they keep extra chairs and tables. After he was confronted he began to cry about his drinking problem. This lead to a quick chat about him and who he was and what he needed to do. We didnt have him in the wedding and just went with an uneven number of groomsmen and bridesmaid's. 

I havent heard from my brothers friend in awhile nor about him but it was very eye opening. It made me realize how fortunate I am to be free of an addiction. He wasnt someone you would expect to go through something like this and I hope he gets better.",2,2
489,257,"My sister-in-law was diagnosed with diabetes. The health condition became a major concern in her day to day life. She had to adjust her lifestyle in order to manage her condition. Each day was a challenge to keep her blood sugar level under control and at the correct level. 

Previous to the diagnosis, my sister-in-law was a chef and thoroughly enjoyed preparing food for others and entertaining. As time went on her condition became worse as she was unable to make the appropriate changes for controlling her diabetes. She began to suffer consequences from the condition including having body parts amputated. She became more depressed as the condition became more and more debilitating. 

One day she was having dinner in a restaurant and began to have stroke like symptoms. She was rushed to the hospital and was diagnosed with two brain tumors. This news was devastating to me and to all of her family members. 

She only lived a short time after the diagnosis of the tumors. She died within six months of the diagnosis. This was a very emotional event for her two daughters, her husband and her extended family. We all continue to struggle with the fact that she is no longer with us and that she died at such a young age.",3,3
490,258,"One day I was out at Whole Foods shopping for the week. It was a cold day and it seemed like the weather was affecting the moods of the other shoppers. People were rude, they were bumping into me at the store and not even taking the time to say excuse me. 

As I collected my necessities for the week and I went to the check out line I noticed a young women and her two children. She was about 25 or so and her children could not have been more than a few years old each. She was young but had the weathered look of someone who was struggling a bit. Her kids were driving her crazy and I could tell she just wanted to get home. 

Anyways as she is going to pay she sticks her credit card into the machine and it's declined. She tries another card and it's the same result. Again and again for what seemed like an eternity. This lady with her two kids and a cart full of groceries was holding up the line and I could tell things were going to come to a head. 

She finally breaks down and starts weeping. I felt so terrible but as I'm on a budget I was not in the position to help. Finally after about a minute the cashier swipes his card and says ""don't worry ma'am, I know how it feels like to struggle."" There had to be at least a hundred or so dollars worth of groceries and I'm sure this cashier wasn't getting paid much more than $10 an hour. To take your day's pay and to help out a stranger was one of the most touching things I've seen. 

She gave this cashier a big hug and she went about her day. I felt good about the human race for the entire day after that.",3,3
491,259,"I have been going to baseball games for a long time. I used to bring my glove in hopes I would catch a foul ball, but once I got to a certain age, adulthood, I gave up. But still wanted to catch one, just to say I did. 

I went to a game with friends, it was pretty empty in the stands, but it was a nice day for a ballgame. Somewhere in the sixth or seventh inning, after I had gotten a beer, a player lofted a high foul ball that made me jump up because it was close to me. I ran over a few steps with the beer still in my hand but the ball was going to come up short. But then it bounced off the concrete, off a railing, and right into my chest. 

It dropped to the ground and I quickly grabbed it. Unfortunately I did not mention as it hit me, it caused my beer to spill all over my shirt, practically soaking it. But I had the foul ball. 

But once I had it in my hand, I realized it wasn't that important. So I found a kid with a glove and handed it to him, and he was so happy. I spent the rest of the game talking with him and his family. I felt like I made a new friend. 

So the price of a beer, a smelled soaked shirt, I learned a life lesson. It's not always what you catch, it's what you do with it that makes a difference.",3,3
492,260,"My Best Friends Wedding. This event was almost two months ago to the day when I went back to Michigan for my friends wedding and it changed the way I saw our relationship. To give some context we have had some tough times and ups/downs as friends and kind of lost the original closeness we had which was sad. There were some times where we had these big fights and our relationship had changed. 

When I went back for the wedding we spend a lot of time together and it felt like old times again. At one point he called me his best friend when we were in a group and I almost wanted to get teary because I had not heard him say something like that in a handful of years. It was really meaningful for me as an individual and I also think for us as a couple of friends as stupid as it sounds. 

One night we stayed up until about four am just sitting outside looking at the stars and telling dumb stories of things we used to do when we were younger. While we can never go back to that time exactly, it was really great feeling good again and knowing that we were friends without having to feel uncomfortable like we sometimes used to. We played ping pong and jammed on instruments, to be honest we also had some drinks while we were doing all of this! 

If we would have had more time we probably would have watched a movie but the guy had a wedding the next day! And then the day of the wedding it was just so great to see him happy and married. It was like everything bad that happened before didn't matter and we could go back to being best friends. Nothing else mattered, all of the fights and stupid things we got mad about. 

I will never forget my best friends wedding, I am glad I made it back. We would do anything for each other and it was a great reminder of that very fact.",3,3
493,261,"In June of 2019, my fiance and I began the process of searching for a new home. The process was long and grueling. We saw tons of houses in our area. We have never been so overwhelmed. After seeing about 10 different townhouses/homes, we decided to use a realtor to assist. Jim was great to work with. He knew exactly what we wanted and was immediately able to provide us recommendations. 

We finally started seeing houses that we really liked. We ended up finding a house and loved it. We put an offer in, but were rejected as someone else came in with a much stronger offer. We were devastated. However, we didn't realize how lucky we were. Jim showed us one more house. The house was completely redone, in our hometown, and close to two major highways. We were so lucky that we didn't get the prior house as this one was better. 

We knew as soon as we walked through that this was the one. We put an offer but that was rejected. After some negotiating we provided an offer that was accepted. After a few months of searching diligently, we finally found our house. This was honestly one of the most memorable moments of my entire life. You can only buy your first home one time.",3,3
494,262,"Last week I was on my way to work when someone hit my car from behind. Fortunately, it wasn't a hard hit because because we were only driving about 15-20 miles per hour. There was a woman with 2 small children in the car that hit my car. We both pulled over to the side and eventually moved into a parking lot. 

 

The woman who hit my car did not speak English and I was having a hard time understanding her. I speak spanish but it's a bit rusty. I had my daughter help translate because she speaks spanish fluently. The woman gave my daughter her ID and some paperwork from the car. 

I wanted my daughter to let the woman know that since there wasn't really any damage to my car, I wouldn't call the police or file a claim. When my daughter was talking to the woman their conversation became animated. I was picking up on the conversation in bits and pieces but couldn't really understand why they were so excited. They continued speaking for a while and my daughter pulled out her phone and started searching for something on her phone. 

She showed the woman an image of my daughter with another young girl from about 15 years ago. Then the excitement really grew. The woman wrote down a phone number and gave it to my daughter. Finally, my daughter and the woman hugged and my daughter and I went back to my car. 

It turns out that the woman that hit my car is the mother of one of my daughter's school friends from a long time ago and the two young children in the car were my daughter's classmates children. The woman had given my daughter her daughter's phone number so they could reconnect. It's a small world.",2,2
495,264,"My mother passed away at the end of March and my sister and I made the funeral arrangements for her. The entire process was sad and painful but at least we had each other to get through it. It was stressful at the funeral home because the funeral director was constantly trying to upsell us. The money wasn't the issue. We simply wanted to follow our mother's wishes for a simple gravesite service with her priest present. The funeral director, however, kept pressing us to provide a large tent that was very expensive, as well as other amenities that we didn't think would be necessary but she literally browbeat us for more than an hour to agree to them. 

We were both very upset when we got back to our car. We didn't have a choice of where to go as my father is buried at the same cemetery and of course we wanted them to be together. It made a stressful time even more stressful. It simply wasn't necessary. 

On the day of the funeral it was a lovely Spring day, my mom's favorite season. We had a gravesite service and her priest did a beautiful job. I was surprised and moved when my brother-in-law's mother, who was close friends with my mother, quoted an Irish blessing that my mom always loved. 

As hard as her passing was the funeral, with all of her family present, reminded me instead of the very good aspects of her life and the times she inspired, supported, and - always - loved us. As hard as it was putting the details together in the end it was a perfect service.",3,3
496,265,"I want to summarize when I received my PhD. I had been working toward this goal for eight years specifically, and 14 years overall. I had spent an enormous amount of time and effort finishing this project. The most memorable part was the submission of my dissertation for graduation. 

I had spent so much time away from my family, and I had spent a lot of money trying to accomplish this goal. I spent a lot of time avoiding friends, avoiding exercise, and avoiding family in order to finish this project. It was trying because I missed my family and friends. I also had a very troubling experience with my adviser, who tried to fail me twice and required me to do extra work. 

But it was an emotional moment, too. Overall, I was moved because so many people supported me and my goals. By the end of the project, my friends and family had helped me through the hardest time of my life. 

This was a significant moment because my family had very little education. My mom died when I was young, so I had a lot of difficulty achieving this goal. Therefore, this moment was very important and moving to me, as it was the culmination of my life's dreams. I couldn't have done it without the support of my friends and family.",3,3
497,266,"I have recently joined a RCIA training class at my Catholic church to become confirmed Catholic. a few weeks ago during Sunday Mass, I and the other members of my class were introduced to the church congregation. We were given a script of things we were to say during the short ceremony when the priest would do the introductions. He was to also say a prayer for our successfully completing the class. 

I had been told generally what to expect, but of course, it didn't go perfectly. Everything went well, except I got confused once about where I was supposed to say my little part of the script - but it worked out. I wasn't nervous, but I was deeply moved by this ceremony. 

It's really one of the things that has drawn me to the Catholic religion-the ceremony and sacredness of every little thing that is done. I love the music. The beauty of the church is striking. 

Anyway, we finished our little ceremony with few mistakes. We had walked up the steps at the alter to be closer to the priest, who isn't a young man and he's slightly limited in mobility. Turned out he wasn't going to come close to us, and our sponsors were to come around from behind to face us and do part of the blessing that the priest would have done. A bit clumsily, they inched around us and accomplished the task. Then it was over. 

We returned to our pew in the front and the Mass continued. Quite an experience.",2,2
498,268,"After going through the longest 4 years of my life and constantly feeling like it was never going to get any better, things are finally starting to look up! Since I lost my home, the best paying job I have ever had, all of my material items, my family, several friends, my kids temporarily and any thing else I could lose, I found I was starting to lose my self-confidence, my faith and even myself. 

I lost everything I cared about, was mentally and physically abused, heart-broken, homeless, hungry and lost. This continued on for years with little to no change or progress, no matter what I did or how hard I tried. Feeling the most lonely, sad, tired and hopeless I have ever felt in life, I started to give up. 

About a month ago, however, I was shown just how fast life can turn around. I woke up one day that was looking to be just as empty and hopeless as every other day, oh how life is full of surprises! I was randomly blessed with a home after being homeless for years. Someone paid the first few months bills for me, got me moved in and helped me see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

My kids will be back home with me soon and I am starting to find myself again! Never give up! It's never too late! And do not ever forget that life can change in a blink of an eye. Keep pushing!",3,3
499,269,"I recently suffered a broken leg. I was working on a ladder painting my house. After a long afternoon of painting, I was feeling a bit tired and began to descend the ladder. I missed a rung on the ladder and fell about 9 feet. When I hit the ground, I felt incredible pain in my left leg. 

After standing up and trying to walk, I couldn't put any pressure on my leg and the pain was almost overwhelming. Luckily, my wife was home at the time and drove me to the hospital. After waiting for over an hour, I was finally seen by a doctor in the emergency room. 

The doctor began the examination by moving my leg and I nearly screamed from the pain. He gave my a shot filled with pain medication of some kind and sent me for a x-ray. The x-ray determined that my leg had fractured just below the knee. Luckily, it was a clean break. 

I was given a flexible cast, a prescription for antibiotics and pain pills, and sent home. It has now been about a month since the accident. I am no longer in pain. The flex cast can come off in about two weeks. 

I am grateful to have recovered and I will take ladders more seriously the next time I paint my house!",3,3
500,270,"I recently went to my best friend's wedding in Spain. This was about 4 months ago, and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. 

I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. 

People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. 

Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people. 

Since I have been back, I have already begun planning my trip back, as well as learning Spanish, and this trip had a strong unexpected impact on my life.",3,3
501,271,"Tonight is March 17th 2019, one of the most worst days of my life. As I was sitting in my room, I happened to glance outside to the parking lot of my building. I looked in the spot where my car was parked and noticed something odd. It looked like someone was in my car. 

I got up to take a closer look and sure enough, two people were sitting in my car, rummaging through my belongs. Anger took over me, and without thinking, I ran downstairs to confront them. 

""Hey, what the hell are you doing in my car? You know I'm a federal officer, and you just broke into my car??"" I said. One of the men replied, ""so?"" I didn't say anything else, I just turned around to walk back to my apartment so I could call the cops. 

As I'm coming up the stairs, my roommate is coming downstairs. She had seen everything from the bedroom window and came down to see what was going on. I rushed passed her, heading up the stairs, as I ran past her I told her they just broke into my car and I was calling the police. 

While I'm running up the stairs, I can hear my roommate trash talking the suspects. Telling them to get a job and things like that. I live on the third floor and by the time I got to the bottom of the third floor stairs I heard my roommate yell out ""he just tried to hit me with a bat"" I hurried as fast as I could to get to my apartment. 

I grabbed the closest weapon I could find, a knife, and headed back downstairs to help my roommate. I ran up to the guys with the bat and one proceeded to swing at me several times. I put my arm up as he tried to swing for my head, and he broke my arm. 

Eventually the suspects were arrested. I will never forget this day and how much fear and anger I felt, and still feel to this day. I could have lost my life that night but I'm grateful I didn't.",3,3
502,272,"My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good. 

However, one of the really suprising thing was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94 but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the phillipines. One man was laid off and took a low end job and he admitted that his parents were supporting him. 

There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and i kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures and it became very raw and personal. 

Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had been not very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so suprising, because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy. 

Yet through the stories of strangers I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little we were so close. However, as she became a teenager we have a more strained relationship. But after this trip we are as close as ever.",3,3
503,273,"About three months ago I was involved in a car accident. The accident happened on the Highway as I was getting onto the ramp. It happened as I got off work. My shift was late at night. I worked late that night and I was exhausted. 

It seemed like a normal work night as I cloaked out and proceeded to my truck. The only thing that was different that night is that I was very tired from working. Sometimes I take a nap before I drive home. For some reason I did not take a nap to rest up before I started my trip home. 

As I was driving to get on the ramp to the Highway I started to go around the curve of the ramp. Halfway around the ramp I soon lost control of the truck. I did not realize the the road was wet. While I was working it rained a little but I did not noticed. 

As I accelerated up the ramp I lost control of the truck. My steering wheel locked. My front truck tires locked as well. As I lost control of my truck it seemed like my entire life flashed before me i those few seconds. I was really scared. 

I hit the guard rail and crashed my back bumper. I got out of the truck and realized that I was not hurt. I walked away from the accident unharmed and I am very grateful.",3,3
504,274,"My husband and I have suffered from fertility struggles for over 10 years. We didn't seem to have an issue getting pregnant at first, but we kept experiences losses at various points throughout each pregnancy. With each loss I lost myself a little more, and felt defeated, almost like I had done something wrong somewhere in my life to deserve some of the worst pain a person could ever experience. 

Our last loss was a third trimester loss, two days before my due date. Everything looked great through the pregnancy and I thought ""this is it, finally! we made it to the end safely"", until those dreams were shattered just as quickly as the pregnancy progressed. We discovered at a routine non stress test that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed from a cord accident. Even though each loss prior to this had been difficult, this was the worst. My entire life went dark and I no longer cared about anything. I can truly say this was darkest moment in my life. 

After months of suffering, my husband took me on a vacation to help me renew my spirit and mood, and surprise, we ended up getting pregnant on this trip. I felt so detached during this pregnancy and considered terminating as I was so certain it was going to end badly again. 

It is my pleasure to say it did not. Our daughter is now 2 months old, and while I fear that something horrible could still happen, I have never felt so much joy in my life. I never thought I would be given the chance to be a mother, and I thank God everyday for finally giving me the blessing of motherhood.",3,3
505,275,"At the beginning of June, my wife and I took a vacation to Washington State. We stayed in Snoqualmie, which is about an hour East of Seattle. We rented a convertible Mustang, which was really fun because the weather was beautiful and having the top down made it feel like we were more a part of the magnificent scenery. In fact, we never saw a single drop of Washington's famous rain during the four days we were there. We even only got clouds for part of one day. 

We stayed at a place called Rockwood Farm, which has ""Washington's most liked front gate on Instagram"", which sounds dumb, but the driveway really is something special to see. The farm isn't really so much a farm as it is a log mansion sitting on several acres of land on the North Fork Snoqualmie river. There was a playground on the property for kids. Also, there was a heard of elk that roamed the grounds and weren't particularly bothered by people. Mt. Si loomed in the background. 

We mostly spent time exploring the Snoqualmie area, but we also spent a little time in Seattle. One day, we took the ferry from Seattle over to Poulsbo. Seeing Mt. Rainier from the ferry was like nothing I've ever seen before.",2,2
506,276,"3 months ago, I moved out of my old town into a new city. I had lived in my college town for a year after graduating, and in total I had lived there for 6 years. It's a small town, and all of my friends and people I knew had moved away. I finished a music degree and had applied to some graduate programs because I didn't know what else to do. 

Luckily, I did not get in to any program, and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was forced out of this path I had made for myself. Though I was relieved, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I quickly fell into a rut. I felt very mentally and physically stuck in a place that started feeling foreign to me. 

I made the decision to move to a new city, and I saved enough to make a deposit on an apartment. I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home. 

I was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner. 

The new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either. I felt a lack of belonging on that night, and though it was scary, it was very liberating to not be surrounded by old attachments and memories. I felt free from some old patterns and able to start fresh. This was the first move I had made on my own.",3,3
507,277,"About three of four weeks ago I was waiting for refills on three of my medications. In order to save money, I have them sent from my insurance by mail order. I had just run out of the medication for my fibromyalgia when I checked my mail and found something from the pharmacy. But there was only one medication, the one for heartburn. I thought the other two may have been sent separately. I was worried because you're not suppose to stop taking this medication and even missing a single dose can make you a little sick. 

The first day I started getting increased pain, especially in my knees. I also started having problems thinking and concentrating. By Sunday I started feeling very weak, dizzy and like I had a bad stomach virus. I ended up really sick. I couldn't eat much and that also made my blood sugar issues worse. The pain got so intense that it felt as though all my bones were being twisted. It was like being in a nightmare. 

They had agreed to reconsider the medication and said it would take about 10 days. But as things kept getting worse so quickly, I wasn't sure I'd last that long. I live alone, so I kept my door unlocked in case I needed emergency help and couldn't open it myself, or to make it easier to find my body if I died. I didn't bathe for a few days because I worried I'd be too weak to climb out of the bathtub and possibly slip and die slowly from a head injury. 

They finally agreed to cover the medication and sent it express. I am still recovering from this. The worst of the pain is gone, but the knees still hurt. Since I also struggled with depression all my life and this medication also helps there, I've been really struggling with more depression. I'm still having trouble thinking and concentrating and my greatest worry is that my brain might not come all the way back. I'm suppose to see my doctor today to check on the progress. Hopefully he can ease my mind.",3,3
508,278,"My job that I worked for ten years closed it's doors for good. I worked at the store since it's opening, so basically, I was there from birth to death. There were no warnings or signs that it would close, the news came as quite a shock. 

I'll never forget the day my manager pulled me aside and told me the shocking news. I was in a state of disbelief. I knew that from that point on everything will change. I started out as a regular sales associate. I moved my way up the ranks over the years. I worked very hard to get to the position that I was at, but deep down, I wanted to leave and change careers. 

I've been internally battling on whether to stay or go. I've gotten so used to working there, my coworkers, and the familiar faces of the customers. However, I knew it was time to move on, I just needed a push to do it. I feel like everything happens for a reason, and maybe this was some higher power forcing me to move on. 

The experience was very new to me. I've never been through a store closing and liquidation before. It's an experience that I'll never forget. You try to stay positive in this bittersweet moment. It's a weird feeling watching day-by-day, the physical look of the store change. It gets emptier and emptier. Products are being marked down to prices as low as you've ever seen. 

The closer you get to the last day, you start to realize that this is the last time you'll ever set foot in such a familiar place. The smells, the sounds, the commute, etc, will all become a distant memory.",3,3
509,279,"This event happened on August 19th of 2019. My mother had a heart attack before she was supposed to go in for surgery. She was having a laprascopic hysterectomy performed because the doctor found cancerous cells in her ovary. As they were prepping her for surgery, something in the anesthesia caused her heart to stop beating. The doctors and nurses had to restart her heart. 

I was then told by the doctor what had happened and that she was going to be transferred to another hospital that could better take care of a patient with heart problems. I was distraught and in a state of panic. My mother is my best friend and I couldn't grasp onto the possibility of me losing her. I have multiple anxiety disorders and they all went into full effect. I had a full blown panic attack on the way to the other hospital. 

I was trying to call my aunt to have her meet me at the other hospital and the call wasn't going through. I actually sat in my car for a few minutes trying to calm myself down knowing that I would have to talk to doctors and nurses. I don't know how but I got myself together enough to be able to be a functioning person. 

I met the doctors who were taking over her care and they were very helpful. She didn't have any real lasting damage and some of the nurses said that this can happen sometimes with giving anesthesia. We are now rescheduling her hysterectomy surgery for a later date and she is now somewhat normal. 

I still remember the utter feeling of helplessness and despair at just the thought of losing my mother and my best friend forever. I am still dealing with the emotional fallout from this and would like to feel normal again.",3,3
510,280,"It was Thursday the 11th of July 2019. My annual results were to be declared on that day. The morning smiled at me brightly when I learnt that I had topped the list of successful candidates in my class. I felt simply overjoyed. My parents and other people at home were jubilant and there was a celebration in my honor. I received a bicycle as a gift from my father. 

At around 12. 30 p.m. there was a call for me. Thought it to be one of the congratulatory calls, I casually went to receive it. I almost screamed with merriment, when I heard an old friend Williams speaking to me! I had lost connection with him about two years ago due to a misunderstanding between us. He wanted to come and meet me. I felt very excited when ultimately we met. We felt like the same old pals! 

Finally, this eventfully glorious day ended and we were in sound sleep. At the end of midnight, I heard a knock at the door. To my utter joy and surprise, I saw my younger brother, who had been missing for six months, standing in front of me! What could be a greater moment than this? We all went mad with joy. I saw tears in everyone’s eyes in my family. These were the tears of extreme happiness.",3,3
511,281,"About three months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend. We had been dating for about 6 months prior to the breakup. Everything was going okay enough, but recently we had started fighting more often and his communication skills left something to be desired. 

I remember I told him that we needed to talk, and asked him to give me a call when he got done with work. I sat in my car in the Target parking lot waiting for his call for a couple hours. I like to have difficult conversations in my car, because it feels intimate, but then I have the option to drive and clear my head. 

My stomach dropped when my music cut out and saw his name on the phone screen. We small talked for a few minutes, and the conversation felt strained/off on both our sides. 

I finally let him know the reason I wanted to talk is because I just couldn't do this anymore. I had spent so much time recently being unhappy and emotional, and I didn't see a pathway out of that for us. 

There was a lot of silence and ""I wasn't expecting this"". He acknowledged that he hadn't been listening to what I told him I wanted and needed, so he was beating himself up and blaming himself. 

We both cried, a lot on the call. I tried to reassure him that I respected him and didn't have any bad feelings toward him, it's just a relationship wasn't working for us. He was so kind and had so many nice things to say to me, that in that moment I wondered if I was doing the right thing. 

The whole conversation was so emotional and I'll never forget hanging up that phone, and feeling a weight being lifted off me. I did the right thing, for both of us.",3,3
512,282,"My wife sat me down and told me how disappointed she was. I have been slacking in the husband area and in the father areas of my life. She said she had been feeling distant from me and she was hoping that by bringing it up, we could fix it. She was coming at me from a place of love and not anger. 

It made me really sad to be called out for not doing what I am supposed to be doing. I felt disappointed in myself. It lit a fire under me that I needed and wouldn't have gotten had she not talked to me. 

What is scary is that I probably would have just coasted like that until the problems in our marriage or with my kids were past fixing. I am very grateful to my wife for having the courage to approach a topic that was sensitive and do it in a way that wasn't harmful to our relationship. 

I feel like this was a turning point in my life. I need to stop making excuses. I need to do better. I hope that whenever I start slacking, because let's be honest, eventually it will happen. I hope that I can remember this conversation and correct course. This will be an important memory in my life moving forward.",3,3
513,284,"I was scared when I found out I was pregnant, I didn't think I was ready or able to take care of someone else. I trusted the dad completely, but a baby is a big, life-changing thing. I went in for a regular check-up the day before she were due. My blood pressure was really high, and they told me that I needed to have her that day. 

I felt every emotion at the same time: nervous, excited, anxious, happy, relieved, nauseous. I didn't know what to expect, and I wasn't fully able to comprehend that I was about to hold her in a few hours. 

The next 12 hours were all pain. I cried, I resented her and her dad, I drifted in and out of sleep. I just wanted it to be over, I wasn't even thinking about getting to meet her. All excitement was gone. I just wanted everything to stop. 

Then I heard her cry. Oh, my God. Her cry brought me whooshing back into the present. It was the only thing I heard. They handed her to me, still covered in my blood and her goo. She was purple and angry and wrinkly. She was so beautiful. She was so perfect. Nothing else existed in the whole world while I was looking at her. 

Every day I look at her and think about how amazing she is and how perfectly I made her and how lucky I am to have her. I would do it all again 100 times for her.",3,3
514,285,"I was feeling very down on myself for awhile, so I decided to hop on Tinder. I'd never used any dating apps before and all my relationships had come from jobs I worked. The initial reaction from Tinder was a rush of excitement and almost adrenaline like. I chatted with various people. I ended up having to cut it off with someone because they seemed far too odd, I got ghosted, I met up with a much older person than me and we ended up being friends, most chats went nowhere. 

One Sunday morning right before I planned to delete the app I took a look at all of the people who had swiped on me, figuring ""what's the point?"" I saw a 21 year old girl who was a student at the university I work at (I was 24). She was pretty but I couldn't tell much from her bio other than her major and that she was a tour guide. 

A couple hours later I get a message, ""you may have a baby face, but it's adorable. What are you up to today?"" We seemed to have a lot in common, especially since we both knew the university and area well. We hammer out the details, she's no more than 7 minutes from me in an apartment complex. I get there around 7pm and head up to the apartment and I'm very nervous. I'm pretty introverted so meeting people like this is not my thing. 

She opens the door for me and looks like her profile. We talked for a while introducing ourselves and decide on a movie. The stream was having buffering issues so Deadpool turned into a 4 hour movie. But I was glad the movie kept pausing, because we talked a ton and I knew there was something about her that made me feel comfortable and at ease. About 5 minutes into the movie she slides across the couch and goes ""excuse me"" and bumps into me. I still laugh about that to this day. For the rest of the movie we cuddled, adjusting so that we were laying down. It was a great time overall, and after that we cuddled for a bit. 

Fast forward to 7 and I have to go to work. I've been at her place for 12 hours and never slept. From this point on, we're constantly seeing each-other, I realize I love this woman and she feels the same way. Fast forward to present time and she is currently my fiancee and I have never been happier, all from a random Tinder date.",3,3
515,286,"I finally got promoted as supervisor from the current project I am working on in my field of work which is graphic arts and design. Ever since I started down this path I have found myself at a loss because somehow everyone seemed to be doing a better job than I was. Everyone else in my class seemed to grasp the concepts a lot quicker than I did so ultimately I felt like I was a failure. 

Although I didn't give up, I would spend extra hours after work to try and catch up and sharpen up my skills in the areas that I was lacking. Fortunately my boss somehow noticed how hard I was working and decided off my ranking in the project I'm currently working on. 

Don't get me wrong I know what I'm doing in the field I just learn at a slower pace. But this just goes to show that hard work really does pay off and it feels amazing to not have given up on my dream. Now I'm even more motivated to work hard towards my goals and hopefully I will make it big one day. 

The moral of the story is that no matter how, no matter how useless what you're doing seems, there's always someone watching what you do and if you work hard enough toward something you will eventually achieve that goal if you don't give up. 

Back when I was younger I used to give up on my goals very quickly when I got frustrated. Then I would get disappointed because I would see that my progress was getting nowhere. I'm older and I have experienced this for myself. I can honestly say that giving up is never the answer. Whether it takes a couple weeks or couple of months never give up on what you believe on.",3,3
516,288,"The most memorable event for me in the last few months was going to a cheese festival. My fiance's mom wanted to come visit us that weekend but we had already had plans to go to this festival. She decided that she would come with us as well. 

It was so hot outside, in the upper 80s. The event was outdoors, on the streets, with no respite from the sun. This made it challenging for vendors to keep their cheeses cold and stocked. The event drew a bigger crowd than they had imagined. Many vendors started selling out of their most popular items within the first few hours. 

We found a small cafe that had a table available after being told that it would be over an hour wait at the location we originally planned to eat at. We quickly realized why the cafe was so empty. The food was like something they would serve at Fyre Festival. The Caesar salad was just a few pieces of lettuce and dressing. 

We could complain, but we were just so relieved to be inside and out of the heat. Later, we found humor in the conditions of the food we ordered. 

This is a fond memory for me because I do not often get to spend time with my future mother in law, so it was nice to have time to bond.",2,2
517,289,"For my whole life, I have had a fainting disorder. My doctor thought it might be a condition called POTS. It took months to get a cardiologist to order the test, for some reason. They seemed to test me for everything else first. I eventually went to a heart hospital and had a test called a tilt table test. In this test they strap you to a table, with a pillow behind your head. You lie down for a while, and then they tip up the table to an angle less than 90 degrees. For about half an hour you just stand still and everyone waits to see if you are going to have symptoms. 

I didn't think I was going to have any, and the test was almost over. When I had finally decided I was never going to faint, I did. The nurse asked me how much I remembered. I said, ""I remember saying I feel weird."" She replied, ""Wow."" So I have no idea how many things I must have missed between passing out and coming to. 

I was so grateful that I had proven this condition to the medical community that I was laughing and joking around with the four people who had been monitoring me. I was really grateful, and so grateful, that I was just happy. 

I did feel awful once I got home, but it was also a relief to finally know I would be getting some answers to a lifelong health problem.",2,2
518,290,"A couple months ago, I went to a comedy show to see my boyfriend and 2 other friends in a comedy show. Before the show started, a group of drunk middle aged people wearing ""fun hats"" came in and asked for discounts on tickets. My friend who was producing the show foresaw them becoming a problem, and warned them that they had to remain respectful and not disrupt the show. 

Once the show started, they started getting loud, heckling the comedians, have loud conversations amongst themselves, and interrupting the show over and over. My friends on stage were struggling to keep the show going and not lose the audience by being too hard on them. 

I was finally fed up and yelled out for them to shut up. This caused a chain reaction where other frustrated audience members started yelling at them, confrontations between other audience members and them, some of the other comedians trying to get them to leave and then finally the show runner came to ask them to leave. 

The main ringleader was wearing a pirate hat and refused to go after his friends did. He would start feigning falling over into the chairs when my friend touched his arm, and getting in front of the stage and shouting so that no one could move on. Finally the show runner had enough and have him some money back so that he would leave. 

The show went on, but the energy of the room had changed, and no one did particularly well after that. 

I was so frustrated for my friends, whose sets were ruined, and my friend the show runner who I was worried had lost money since he had to return so many ticket prices for the group of hecklers. The selfishness and audacity of the group was infuriating. 

Later in the night however I got 2 pieces of information. First, the show runner gave them some singles instead of the full cost of the singles and they were too drunk to notice. And second, that a drunk man in the pirate hat, was spotted getting a sobriety check by the police on the side of the road not far away from the comedy show. There is no way that he was sober enough to have passed.",3,3
519,292,"I remember exactly how it ended. That morning you asked if I would be happier without you. Unsure, I remained silent. I was hoping you would reassure me that I wouldn't be. Instead, you took my silence as an affirmation that I would be better off. You went to work and I went on with my day as normal. Little did I know that everything had changed. 

Days later, I tried to reconnect and work on the relationship, but you were no longer interested. It hurt me tremendously. I was counting on you for years, and despite all our problems, I was still trying to fix things. Used to our fights, I expected things to fall back into place in the next few weeks, since we could never stay away from each other for too long. That never happened. 

I reluctantly began going on dates with other people to try to move on and heal from your rejection, and you took that as a sign that I was seeking something or something else. I didn't know what else to do to try to fix something you didn't want anymore. 

Months later, we remain separated and rarely talk. It's still unbelievable to me because I never imagined we could go longer than a day without taking to each other. I have yet to tell my parents that it ended. I think that's because part of me is still holding on to hope that we'll work out. However, I'm simultaneously starting to accept that things are this way. 

Even though I still miss you, I no longer have the desire to tell you about everything that happens in my life. I no longer have the urge to talk to you all the time or think about you constantly. It's unfamiliar, but I guess this is what you wanted. I don't know the details of your life anymore and that's ok. 

In the end, I just hope we're both happy wherever we end up. I just never would have imagined it ending this way.",3,3
520,293,"We had been down for about 2 months without a vehicle and my husband is a mechanic, but he was staying in doors all day and was not going out till dark and tried to work on it for thirty minutes to an hour. We are also down one bathroom, the other has been under construction for the past 7 years. 

My husband was not working on any of it, i am not even going to go into our bathroom. I have bought tools for him, I have gotten him equipment, and I have bought him the materials. I have gotten so mad, that it actually turned into major depression and I was just so tired and sad that I wished to never wake up most mornings. When I mentioned doing any of these projects during the day, I was told that he needed more materials of more than one hundred dollars, and with the car he just could not figure it out even though we had engines that he could put in. 

I was so mad, angry, hurt and just had given up, every time I looked at him. I had insurance on another truck that I can not drive, just so I could get to my appointments, without begging for help from my family. I am still trying to recover from that. 

I still can not afford the materials for the rest of the bathroom yet, we are on a very limited income. I am seeing my physiologist once a week now to get back to my normal. 

I do not know if or when that truck or my blazer will ever get fixed, but at least I do not have to look at them anymore. They are covered up in weeds so that I can not see them or even see the front of the yard anymore. That is how high the weeds are there is a path to the one truck but that is even getting narrow. I guess if I do not get things done, then nothing will get done.",3,3
521,295,"Today is the day of the competition, we were so excited but apprehensive about this trip, Ben has been preparing for several months but are you ever really prepared? I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly. 

How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6am, traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed, costume, skates, snacks. 

Tony, my husband was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine! 

Ben got into costume around 7am, practice ice went well and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves, how could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem fazed at all. 

Another boy and his family were there but they were not remotely friendly, they kept glaring at us which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl skated and did ok but did not win, she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money. 

It was time for Ben to skate and we all held our breath, he did an amazing job and we were not sure if it was good enough to win but it was good. Ben's coach said ""he has got this, he will win"" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced but when they were, sure enough, he had won! 

It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try to not appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony which was incredibly rewarding and then the event was over! 

We were exhausted and went home. And it was still only 10:30am!",3,3
522,296,"A few months ago, we took a vacation back to my home with my son. It was scary because it was my son's 1st time flying and I was pretty stressed out about it. It was the 1st time I had been back home in years, and the 1st time for most of my family to meet my son, who was one and a half at the time. 

The flight went better than expected and we eventually landed, rented a car, got through customs and drove to visit family. We spent a lot of time with my mother, who had recently moved into an apartment and was living on her own for the 1st time in her life. My father passed away 3 years ago and previously she had been living with my younger sister. But she decided everyone needed their own space and moved out. 

We got to see all my cousins and aunts and uncles, and my son got to meet his cousins for the 1st time. My husband also got to meet many of my family members he had never met before too. 

We had time to see my best friend in the world, who I do not get to see enough. We visited my old childhood home to see how it looked, drove past my high school and grade school and toured around all the places that had meaning to me growing up. 

My mother was so happy to spend time with her grandson. Of course she spoiled him with toys and presents. To be able to share this with my son and my husband was pretty amazing. 

We live so far from where I am from it was really great to be back with them.",2,2
523,297,"One of the most memorable moments in my life happened 5 months ago. This was the year of my graduation from university. I could not believe that I spent the last five years of my life working towards this day. During my time in university, I met many people of different backgrounds. Because of this I learned about many different cultures and became more culturally enriched myself. What makes this significant is the path it led me on today. Thanks to the many great people I collaborated with during university, I received an opportunity to work for a great company that embraces and supports diversity. 

The day of graduation is one that I still remember as if it was just yesterday. The feeling of accomplishment, but also some sadness still lingers on until this day. During my last year, I got realy close to some people which is unusual for me. Many of the people I interacted with during my schooling were what i would consider acquaintances. However, these people I met I could actually call my friends. The reason for my sadness is that I knew that once I graduated, I would most likely not keep in touch as much as we did before. 

In the end, we all went to school for one reason, to get a nice paying job. We didn't really go to school to meet new people; at least that's what it felt like. Anyways, the biggest thing I take away from this day is that all good things must come to an end at some point. I was counting down the days to graduation because I knew once it was over, that there would have to be a big change in my life; something I always feared. 

Most people would describe their graduation day with feelings of relief, happiness, and accomplishment. For me it was a bit different, almost the opposite. While the friends I made were probably the best part about going to school, would it even matter 5 years from now? I'm glad that as of now everything seems to be going well and my work has paid off. What saddens me is that I will never get to live those moments again like if it was the day it happened.",2,2
524,298,"It all started this summer for my family reunion. The Ricardo Family Reunion was to be held as a 2 day event, staring on Saturday, June 20th and Sunday, June 21st. It was a lovely day. On Saturday we held a family picnic at the Pavilion. We played baseball, basketball, volleyball and the kids had a water slide. We had a large selection of food. We traced our family generation back as far as 9 generation. We learned so much about where we came from and how strong of a family line we have. 

The children enjoyed them self, playing with cousin they and Aunts and Uncles that just met or haven't seen in a long time. My great-great-great grandfather was an Indian Chief. We learn that we belong to the Cherokee Indians. My family is mixed with Spanish, and French. We listen to stories told by the elders about events that had happened in their days. 

We were told stories about how the family stayed and worked together. We talked about the many fishing boats that the family had on Grand Isles. We also visited Madewood plantation where my Grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done a lot of work in restoring the plantation. We even went to New Orleans and toured the city. We visited where my grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done some work in the French Quarter. 

The next day we all celebrated by going to Mass together. Being with family is a blessing and sometime we let the world and material things get in our way and make us forget about what is important. The best time is spending it with family, united in love and doing the simple things in life.",2,2
525,299,"Our dog injuring his eye was absolutely terrifying and stressful. I remember going to work that day from camp, putting him on his lead so he could hang out outside, enjoying the sunshine on my walk. I took lunch early that day for some reason, and when I got back home he was still outside. As I approached he seemed fine (if a little quiet), but when I made it to him...His right eye was swollen shut and was tender to the touch. He would barely let me look at at it, which is especially odd for him. He kept scratching it with his paw as though there was an itch he just couldn't get to, and the swelling was spreading a bit down his face and snout. He was obviously in pain, and I had no idea what or how or when; all I knew was that my boyfriend, whose dog he is, was out for the next 3 days on a wilderness excursion with no contact and suddenly I was in charge. 

The next two days were awful. He got Benedryl at first, but when that didn't do anything the vet came out to see him. Somehow, he had managed to poke a hole in his cornea and if things went wrong he would go blind in that eye. When I heard that, I didn't know what to do-- how do I break that to my partner?! How did he manage to poke a hole in his cornea while by himself?! It's not like that's something that 'just accidentally' happens all the time. 

He ended up in a cone for weeks, and had to take multiple medications-- one of which had to go in his swollen-shut eye. He wasn't allowed to be outside alone anymore and had to go to a friend's house every day before work. Because of his injury and the resulting cone, he was lethargic and not eating very much, which was compounded by the fact that my partner was still not home or able to be contacted. 

It ultimately worked out, and the dog did not lose his eye. My partner came home and I saw him run through every emotion I had had for the last few days in minutes as I brought him up to speed. Pupper still goes to the friend's house every day (we call it 'doggy daycare'), and we've become much closer to those friends as a result. OH, and he got his outside privileges back :)",3,3
526,3,"At the beginning of the summer, my husband had relapsed back into his meth addiction. He had been clean for 5 years at that point. He cheated on me with another women, he stole our bill money for drugs, and became a stranger in my soulmate's body. I realized that I had to get out of the situation, he wasn't going to stop on his own. I began working online so I could keep an eye on the house. 

One afternoon, my husband had been gone all day, I presumed he was stealing to support his habit. All of a sudden, I saw the car he left in race past the house with police cars in pursuit. A short time later, he tore into the driveway, with the car engine on fire, and ran in the house and into the back bedroom. 

When the police knocked on the door, I was too scared to open it. A few minutes later, they broke the window and I told them I was unarmed and coming out. There were at least 15 police cars surrounding our street. I was in shock and did not know how to deal. They didn't ask me anything, they knew about the drugs and knew they weren't mine. 

I lost my love that day. The innocence of my perceived true love had forever been shattered. It's been three months, he's been in jail since the end of June. I still don't know what will happen to my marriage. I don't know if anyone can come back from that. I have hope that the man I married is still in there somewhere.",3,3
527,301,"In early July I played in a golf tournament that was put on by a foundation that helps families deal with cancer. It isn't so much of a research and looking to beat the disease as it is to help families lead some kind of a normal life and allows children to do things like attend camps and parents to have such things that are taken for granted like ""date nights"". 

I played with three of my good friends who I have known since high school. One of my friends recently lost his dad to cancer. I was very close to his dad and remain close to his entire family. It was a very hard time that he went though as well as the rest of the family. Truthfully I struggled with it as well as, although he had been fighting cancer for 20 years, the end came pretty quick. 

At this tournament there was one hole that is called the dedication hole. On this hole every person is given a new golf ball where they write the name of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life. Without being prompted all of us put down my friends dad's name. It was at this point that my friend and I both became very emotional. 

This is a tournament that both of us have played in for a number of years, but even so I didn't foresee the level of emotions that we would have at this point. I think that this will be something that will stick with both of us for a long time. I saw his mother recently and she mentioned that it really meant a lot to her son and he had mentioned it a number of times to her and other family members how touched he was. 

It will remain something that I will hold near and dear to my heart for a long time.",3,3
528,302,"I attended a friend's bachelor party held in Canada. We went to many restaurants. We ate foie gras at a restaurant. I think it was a delicious meal and was disappointed that I had been full near the end of the meal. 

We visited many museums in the city where we stayed. The museums of Canada don't seem that different from those in America. I liked a painting of a stranded ship where the crew members had descended into chaos. 

I think the most memorable part of the trip was my friend making a speech in a karaoke lounge. I was happy for him and the new marriage path he was about to embark on. 

There were times in the trip where I kind of spaced out and was just happy. I felt a great deal of unity. I had not seen some of these friends for over a year. I felt nostalgia when we recalled past times. I began to miss them even though we were still together. I kind of dreaded the trip being over. 

This was the third memorable bachelor party that I've been to. I only wish we had more time to go hiking or something.",2,2
529,303,"Today is my sister's 20th birthday. My mom actually told me what we were doing earlier this week. She decided that the whole family is going to go to the local zoo. After the zoo, we are going to go get something to eat at a kind of nice restaurant nearby. This is all going to be a surprise to my sister since it is her birthday. 

We got a slow start today, as usual. After we finally made it out of the house, we all got into the family's minivan. We then began our trip to the zoo. 

We finally arrived. It was a hot sunny day. It was a perfect day for the zoo. We got to see all cool types of animals. I think my favorite was the monkeys. One of them had a back injury for some reason, so it was secluded from the others while it healed. The penguins were pretty neat too. 

After we had finished seeing everything the zoo had to offer, we got back into the minivan and departed for the restaurant we were going to. I think everyone was exhausted by time we got to the restaurant from walking around the zoo all day in the hot sun. 

I didn't really like the place we went to eat, because the music was just a little to loud. The food was pretty decent at least. We paid the bill and headed home to sing happy birthday to my sister and eat cake. 

This was probably my favorite part, because I could finally sit down and relax.",2,2
530,305,"About two months ago, my sister asked me to purchase some tickets to a concert for her husband and gave me $800 to buy them for her. She asked me to do so on her behalf, because it was a surprise gift for their anniversary, and she did not want him to know that she was doing it. 

The afternoon that she gave me the money, I went home and put it in my desk drawer, with intentions of depositing it in my bank the following day so that I could make the purchase. Later that evening, I had a friend come over who was having some problems with her boyfriend. We talked to each other and caught up and she asked if she could use my computer, which I of course said yes. I was on the phone with my husband who was out of town and in a different room while she was on the computer. 

Shortly thereafter, she suddenly had to leave and her reason behind it was unclear and sounded suspicious, but knowing her I summed it up to she was lying about what she was really going to do and I didn't really care too much. 

The next day I was getting ready to leave to go to the bank and I opened up my desk drawer and the money was gone! I checked my wallet and purse to see if for some reason I had put it in there, although I know for a fact that I never moved it. I immediately knew that she had stolen the money from me, and her wishy-washy excuse for leaving now made perfect sense. 

I was furious. I called her immediately and she did not answer. I called her 3 more times and she still did not answer. So I sent her a text message and pretended like everything was ok so that she would call me back. She called me back and I asked her if she took the money. She claimed to not know what I was talking about and tried to blame it on my kids (who were all asleep when she was there) and I could sense that she was lying yet again. 

There was not much that I could do at this point but to write her off as a friend and know that she could not be trusted. This was extra hurtful to me because I now had to come up with $800 of my own money to pay for the tickets since I was the person trusted to do this. I struggle financially as it is, so $800 is a lot of money to me.",3,3
531,306,"About a 3 months ago I had to put my dog of 15 years down because of medical issues. My dog Tucker was always full of life and one of the happiest dogs you would ever meet - he was sweet, affectionate, and loyal. 

This event took place in June during the late evening at my house. I came home from work and noticed that I wasn't greeted by my trusty companion and knew something was wrong. I walked around the house searching for him and calling his name but couldn't find him anywhere. Finally, I looked under the bed and there he was, just laying there, staring at me with a sad face. 

I eventually got him out from under the bed and tried to get him to play but he wasn't interested. I then tried to feed him (normally he's crazy for dinner) but he wasn't the least bit interested in the food. Tucker was still very affectionate and wanted me to pet him and give him a hug, but he still wasn't himself. 

We laid down on the couch and he sat on my lap and watched tv with me for awhile. Tucker then got up and went into the living room and started making coughing noises. I came in and saw that he vomited and that there was blood in it. After that, things escalated rather quickly, and now Tucker was vomiting everywhere and was in severe discomfort. 

I decided to take him to an emergency vet that was open 24 hours near my home. I found out that he has stomach cancer and there wasn't much I could do for him. After hours of crying and laying in the room with him, the vet gave him some pain medicine to help him be comfortable. 

I kissed him and told him he was a good boy and made the decision to end his pain that day.",3,3
532,307,"A few months back I had to re-home my cat. My wife's allergies had gotten worse to the point that she couldn't breathe properly. my cat has been with me well over 15 years to this point. I looked around desperately, because I wanted to find her a good home, it was a stressful period of time. 

The cat has always been attached to me, so I did not want her to feel abandoned. Fortunately, my mother offered to take her in. At first, the boyfriend was not happy about it, and it is his house. Eventually, he warmed up to the idea however. Now I visit her a few times a week, and she still has that familiarity of someone there. 

She has grown attached to the boyfriend. She also already remembers my mother, so that's a plus for her comfort. The most surprising aspect of the entire thing is the fact that it was a happy outcome for not only me, but my cat. Additionally, my wife is doing alot better with the allergies now. 

It's still a major transition for me, I was always used to my cat following me around, sleeping at the foot of the bed, and just our general daily routines. But the fact that i still get to see her, and help take care of her, makes thing's easier to deal with.",2,2
533,308,"Six months ago, my wife began to not feel well. She complained of extreme fatigue, nausea, and felt that she was getting bloated. I suggested she go to the doctor, which she was not a fan of, and this went on for three more days. 

Finally, one snowy Friday evening, she was getting a ride home from a co-worker and called me. She said she was feeling much worse, including dizziness and abdominal pain. I asked her co-worker (who was also a friend of ours) to drive her to the emergency room and I set out to meet her there. It was snowing so hard that I missed the turn to the hospital, so it took me a while to get there but I got there right before they called her back. She looked terrible, and I instantly regretted not being more adamant with my suggestion that she see a doctor earlier. 

They did quite a few tests, and we talked to several different doctors and nurses. Eventually they knew that she was having serious kidney problems, but there was more going on as well. After about seven hours, around midnight, they admitted her and we moved up to a room, where she was the only patient. 

Another hour after that and a different doctor came to tell us that she had cirrhosis, which is eventually fatal without a transplant. She's not much of a drinker, and they said that it's due to what's called a fatty liver. She took the news in stride, asking what she needed to do moving forward, and I was very proud of her strength. 

I drove home around 3 that morning to try to get some sleep, moving at a crawl on icy roads, knowing that our lives were going to be much different now. It turns out that both of her grandfathers died of the same thing. She is determined not to go that way, and is now in Denver, staying with her parents, about to finally get on the transplant list. 

I am still in Albuquerque, holding down the fort - they don't do transplants here so this is the only way we can try get her healthy again.",3,3
534,309,"I recently got a promotion at the company I've been with for four years. It was completely unexpected as I was told the previous year that my company was unable to give anyone a raise due to financial circumstances. I felt like I had worked very hard and deserved a raise, but when I was told they couldn't afford it, I tried to be understanding. 

I later found out that the managers and supervisors were all invited by the vice president of the company to go on a nice family vacation, as well as earned an increase in their salaries. Which, made me realize they were lying when they told us, their employees, that they couldn't afford to give us a raise. They were just keeping the money for themselves. 

At this point I was ready to look for a job elsewhere. However, I really didn't want to leave my job because I liked the people I work with. And the hours are flexible. 

Anyway, I found out that a few of my co-workers actually complained to the president of the company, who just so happens to be the vice president's father. This is a family run business. And needless to say, his father told his son, the vice president, that he needed to find work elsewhere. Which was a complete shock to all of us. I guess his father was fed up with him too. 

In the end we all got the raises we should have earned, plus more.",2,2
535,310,"My son has left the country. That was what I thought to myself as I left the airport last week. Those thoughts brought on a wave of emotions, both good and bad. My son, who has been a daily part of my life for the past 18 years, was going away. My wife and I would not seen him again for about nine months. 

We always knew when he graduated from high school that he would likely be leaving the state for college. That expectation took on a new twist when he was accepted at a school that had a program allowing freshman students to apply to spend their entire first college year studying in Italy. He was thrilled when he was accepted in to the program, and I was happy and proud. 

However I was also nervous and sad. While I am excited for him and the opportuniy he has in front of him over the next year, it still hurts to think of him being so far away. The idea of ""losing"" someone I am used to seeing every day, that I won't be able to help him if he gets sick or hurt, that we won't be able to take a walk together, or throw a ball, or share a soda, or just talk... leaves me with an empty feeling inside. Sure we will text and email, and (hopefully) speak on the phone several times each week, but it is not the same. 

Should I feel guilty over being sad instead of happy for him? In truth, I feel both. I am proud to see him take another step towards growing up and becoming his own man... but I also miss my little boy.",3,3
536,311,"A few weeks ago, I went to dinner with my boyfriend and my best friend. I'd known my best friend since we were pre teens, and this was the first time they had met. It went really well! I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it'd taken quite some time for our schedules to line up. I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent up anxiety about it finally happening. 

My friend texted me asking if I'd like to get dinner, and I let her know that I was with my boyfriend at the time. We got burgers and wings at a place nearby. The food was great, but the company was better. 

We ended up seeing a couple people that my friend and I knew. When we finished eating, we spent some time speaking to them. It was nice to catch up with old friends. 

Afterwards, we went back to my friend's house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog. Seeing them interact was adorable, since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much. 

It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about, and to see them getting along so well. I'm looking forward to spending more time with the two of them in the future.",2,2
537,312,"I hired a lawn service at the beginning of summer. I had a ""not so great"" feeling about him from the start. He's done an okay job, but he's never consistent with timing. He'll show up anywhere from a week to two weeks a part. No problem though. I can deal with that. He emails an invoice on the last day of every month, which is due within 20 days. I always just pay right away, so there's never been a complaint from his end. 

Well, he was here at the end of September, but October 13th came around and he still wasn't here. I hadn't paid for October yet simply because I forgot. I had a lot going on, but it's not like it was late. The payment wasn't even due until the 20th. 

The morning of the 13th, I get this angry email that there will be a late fee for payments made late. So, I immediately grab my invoice to make sure he didn't change the due date on it or something and I missed it. But, nope, it wasn't due till the 20th. So, I shoot him an email saying I had no intention of paying it late, but thanks for the warning, I guess. 

He ends up sending me four rude emails throughout the day saying that just because the bill says the 20th doesn't mean I have to wait till then to pay it. And, he said he doesn't like to babysit customers and all of kinds of other garbage. I was nice initially, thinking maybe he confused me with someone else. I mean, I've always paid like the day I get the bill. He definitely didn't have me confused. He just kept being rude until I finally sent him back a message telling him basically where he could shove his business and what I thought of him. 

It really stressed me out. I couldn't even sleep that whole night because he had me so worked up all day over this. I don't think I've ever had such bad customer service.",2,2
538,313,"My soon to be sister in laws wedding. It was in one of my favorite towns, Gainsville. We each had our own little cottages on the property so I didn't feel rushed or even worried about getting ready on time since we woke up there. 

It was the first wedding I had ever been to as an adult, and also felt super close to the people getting married. The morning was great. I stayed with the boys for the most part since I knew them a bit better than the bridesmaids. We were all swapping stories and kidding around while I helped them get ready. My boyfriend looks amazing in his tux, and it actually made me cry because I had never seen him dressed up like that. It honestly made me feel like I couldn't wait to get married for the first time ever in my life. 

I sat in the front and helped my boyfriends grandparents since they are a bit older and have a hard time getting up and down. The bride and groom looked so amazing. They had been together for 8 years, so this was a really big deal to everyone. The ceremony went off without a hitch. 

Afterwards it was just a lot of fun. The meal was buffet style and I was sitting with my boyfriend, his parents, and his grandparents. I helped his grandparents get food, and again everyone swapped stories. I was so happy to be part of his family and part of this event, and I felt really included. 

At the end, we all got star-wars light-sabers and we made an archway using them for the bride and room to walk through. After that my boyfriend and I spent the rest of the night playing with the little kids who waited the whole day to play with them. We ended up getting beat up like crazy. 

I loved the day, and I wouldn't change it for anything.",3,3
539,315,"I had a surprising conversation with my boyfriend last week. Even though we've been together for almost 8 years, we seem to sometimes have trouble understanding each others thoughts and feelings. I moved away from my children and grandchildren to be here with him, and although we had experienced some problems with finances and my health since then, I think we have mostly been happy. 

The night before, we had been talking about my not really knowing anyone here after all this time, and that I missed having friends and family close by. I guess I was not as clear as I intended. He got very quiet, and a short time later, went to bed. 

The next morning, he was really quiet and not smiling when I smiled at him. He just seemed ""off"", and I thought perhaps he was not feeling well. I asked him what was wrong several times, but it wasn't until several hours had passed that he finally opened up to me. 

He was really sad, and told me that he realized I was not happy with him. He also said that he planned to give me some money so that I could leave, and go wherever it was that I believed I would be happier. I was shocked! 

I explained to him that I loved him so very much, and that I never meant for him to think that he was the reason for any unhappiness on my part. I felt so bad that I had made him feel that way. He was truly heart broken to think that I was that unhappy and that it was his fault. 

I told him we have been through so much together, and that I believed it has brought us closer. I apologized for making him feel like he was responsible for my happiness.",3,3
540,317,"In June, I went to a family reunion. It was held at the home of my cousin's former husband in New Jersey. Last year, he came and picked up me and my partner at our place in New York and drove us there. This time, although one of the cousins organizing the event said she'd try to arrange transportation, she was unable to do so, so we took the bus. This involved taking the subway to Port Authority in Manhattan, then a bus to New Jersey, then calling my cousin on arrival to have someone pick us up. The whole trip should have take a couple of hours. 

I looked at Google Maps before leaving the house, and planned our route. We left the house in ample time to catch the bus suggested by the app. On the way to the bus, I called my cousin to confirm that we were on our way. I found out that the host of the party said we should take a different bus, which was a route run by a different bus company. Naturally, this ran on a different schedule. 

When we arrived at the terminal, we found we'd have to wait an hour for our bus. When we finally got on the bus, we were relieved, and figured we'd see everyone in about an hour's time. Were we mistaken! We hit one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered. The trip took well over two hours. By the time we arrived, some of the guests were already leaving. 

The best part of the whole party was that one of my cousins had come all the way from Massachusetts. She had told me about a year ago that she loves coconut flan. So, I made it and did not tell her. She was so surprised and pleased that she cried. Her husband, who is Cuban, pronounced it ""Tremendo!"" I felt the long trip had been worth the effort.",2,2
541,318,"Recently I have been taking my dog to a local park that is connected to a cemetery in order to let her stretch her legs and hunt for squirrels. We are constantly pulling in there and roaming around the whole area, but we very infrequently meet other dogs and their owners while we are in the back woods area of the park. 

A few months ago, in the spring of this year, we were following the same course as always and we came upon a dog running loose with a collar and tags on its neck. It stopped and was friendly, then continued along the way by itself. Shortly after, me and my dog ran into the owner of the one we had just met, and he was walking another dog on a leash. We said hello to each other and had a brief conversation. 

I could see that the dog he had on the leash was ill in some way, as opposed to the other healthy dog that was running free. We said goodbye and continued on our separate ways along the trail. 

A couple of days later, we ran into the same person at the same park but in a different section of the trail. I got to talk to her for a while about how her dog was going to have to have a tumor removed. It was so heartrending to witness an older dog and what getting ill and dying really entails. I was very touched by the whole situation, and I gave her dog a big hug since he was so adorable. 

After that we did not stay in touch with each other by phone or anything, but I promised to say hi the next time I ran into her there at the park. Sure enough we talked again just a couple of weeks later, and I saw the stitches and the bald spot from the surgery her dog underwent. He was doing well and was happy to meet my dog again, and the two of them ran around until eventually her other dog came back over as well. 

I felt personally touched by my direct experience with this poor dog, and I also felt good because I was able to contribute to his getting better by sharing some CBD dog treats with his owner. The next time I talked to her, she said that they seemed to have a positive effect on him and that she wanted to thank me for telling her about it.",3,3
542,319,"I went to get a shelter dog a couple of months ago. When I was growing up I've had a dog that was my best friend. My dog passed away a few years ago and I became very depressed and my life really slowed down. A couple of months ago I decided it was time to get a new dog to see if it will help my depression. 

I went to the animal shelter to see if I could adopt a puppy. When I got there, there weren't that many left but I saw one that looked like the dog I had growing up. I immediately fell in love with that dog and knew it was the one I wanted and needed. 

From the very first day I took him home it made my mood so much better. It has made me so happy and I'm so glad I made that decision. I spend pretty much all day with that dog besides when I'm at work. When I go out anywhere I take him with me. It started hanging out with my friends more and being more social as well. 

Whenever I'm feeling stressed or depressed I would go take him to the park and it would make me feel better. We go out on walks a lot so I'm also getting more exercise as well. He's going to be my best friend for a very long time.",3,3
543,32,"So at Alchemy we are taking the concept of chemistry and science and turning them into game based learning tools for students and for instructors, but in a way that allows for experimentation and play. The path was going toward academic chemistry. I was good at chemistry, I was good at research and all that stuff. But I realized that I always liked working with young people. So I actually, in 1994, went and worked at Detroit Country Day School, which is a private school. 

And started my job there and loved it, and raised my children. They went through the school, they went to U of M. And after that I started sort of feeling like not as connected to my school as it used to be, because my kids were gone. So I started to look for new things and that was the beginning of Alchemy. 

And if my learning tools can be shown to help students from everywhere get better. And there's like 50% of people that fail organic chemistry. If I could cut that down to 40 %, I think that would be success. But, this is not an easy path, it's really hard. But if you're solving a problem that you know needs to be solved, then the hurdles don't feel quite so high.",2,2
544,321,"The call came at 3 AM. Knew it wasn't a good sign. Mom fell and dislocated her shoulder and tore an artery. I have a sick feeling in my stomach that this is not going to end well. Made the reservations to fly out tomorrow. 

On my way to the airport I got a call from my daughter that she had also torn an artery and was not acting like herself. By the time I reached home my mother had been sent home to hospice care because she had a stroke during the night(nobody noticed) I stepped into a bad dream when I finally got to my childhood home. 

She was in a hospital bed, hooked up to oxygen and barely alert. Alert enough to know it was me, her oldest, her favorite everyone's always told me. She even said my name and that she loved me. 

I swear I spent five days awake, sitting in the rocking chair next to her bed, singing in her ear, saying prayers, talking to her, telling her dad was waiting for her. She died when I was holding her, just mom and I alone in her room, my mouth pressed up against her good ear. I felt her heart stop. 

The aftermath was a blur. Spoke at the memorial service. My mother is gone and it will be 3 months in a few days and I cry when I least expect to and reach for the phone to call her as I did so often, but my mother is gone.",3,3
545,322,"Two weeks ago my partner and I joined her family for an overnight trip to an amusement park for her nephew's birthday. The park was about a four hour drive from the city so we had to wake up quite early in order to make it there at a reasonable hour. I made the unfortunate mistake of drinking far too much tequila the night before so the trip was not very comfortable for me. On top of that, I had the pleasure of being introduced to a whole group of new people that I had never met before. They were all very nice, but I was not in the mood to make introductions and may not have made the most flattering first impression. 

We finally made it to the park but instead of being able to relax and unwind we went right into long lines for thrill rides and roller coasters. Frankly, I thought that I was going to lose consciousness on multiple occasions. My head was killing me and I was having to depend upon my partner in order to remain upright. We ate an extraordinarily heavy lunch and I began to feel a little bit better. Many photos were taken that included my pallid visage and I managed to make it until we finally left for the hotel that we would be staying in that evening. 

Unfortunately, this was not the end of the evening. Our party still needed to go out and buy a cake and eat dinner for her nephew's birthday. When we arrived at the bakery it had already closed, but after some pleading with the remaining staff we were able to go inside and purchase a cake. We then found a nearby restaurant and the celebration was actually quite pleasant. 

That night I slept as though dead even though we were sharing our hotel room with my partner's mother.",3,3
546,323,"About 5 months ago I quit my good job up in Virginia, sold my home and moved back down to Florida. It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle who owns a couple of event planning companies asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get in to my own place. 

At first I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise. 

After being promoted I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally I and a few others had had enough. 

I complained to my Uncle and his best friend who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue. 

Finally I tried to quit several times but was guilted into staying on the job. Then over the course of one week I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle who I was very close to looked out for me in several ways and because of that we became very close. 

The fallout was not pleasant and because of it all the relationship between me and my uncle is now severely strained and I will never work for him again.",2,2
547,324,"This week I went to the hospital to visit my mother. In the past six weeks, her health has gone in steep decline. She is elderly and had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, but had been coasting along for a couple of years without much deterioration. About six weeks ago, we took her to the ER with what we thought was a mild issue. It was not mild. Her illness went a sudden and steep decline. 

When I went to visit my mother this week, I heard her yelling before I entered her hospital room. She did not focus on me when I entered the room and she looked terrified. She kept repeating the same nonsense phrase over and over again. Of course, I wanted to do something to comfort her. She seemed fairly unreachable. 

I finally went to ask for her nurse to come so that we could see if there was a medical intervention that might comfort her. My mother's doctor came to the room and explained that she had been unsettled the previous evening, so she was given a medication. As a result of the medication, she slept last night, all day today, and had recently woke with hallucinations. 

I am generally a stoic person, but while the doctor was talking, I began crying. I could not seem to stop. I cried during my entire drive home. I thought that I had become desensitized to my mother's health decline, but I found at that moment that I could not handle her clearly suffering. 

The hospital is steering clear of the medicine that gave her the hallucinations, so I will hopefully not see my mother looking that terrified again.",3,3
548,326,"About four weeks, my girlfriend took me to her hometown in Pittsburgh. I had never been to the city before or met her parents, so it was going to be a big weekend. We went up on a Friday after work, making the 4.5 hour drive through the Pennsylvania mountains. 

This was a trip we had talked about for awhile, but never could find a free weekend as we are both very busy with work. Finally, we were able to find a free weekend for both of us and booked everything very last minute. We started off getting dinner at an Italian restaurant with her parents, which went really well! I was a little nervous going into the dinner but her parents were very nice and it was a relaxing dinner. 

After dinner we went to our hotel in the city. Saturday I did not think we had any plans, but I was surprised that my girlfriend had a whole day planned out. I was surprised and happy she spent the time to plan a whole fun day for me. We spent the day going to museums, breweries, parks, and ending the day riding a tram up a mountain for a view of the city, and ate dinner up there. It was a really fun day and the whole thing made me really happy. 

The next day, we went to a Pittsburgh Steelers game. The stadium was really cool and it was an exciting game. The fans of the Steelers were so passionate and enthused it made the experience very memorable. 

After the game, we drove home - I drove while my girlfriend slept. It was a tiring weekend as we had a lot of activities, but it was great nonetheless.",2,2
549,327,"A few weeks ago I went to visit my elderly father. He's a terrific man, but has a way about him that is a little intimidating. He's always been in control of everything around him. As I was growing up, I saw him as Superman. The years have taken their toll and he is now in his late 80s and having problems with his health and his memory. It's hard to see Superman become human. 

During my visit, I stayed with him at the retirement home and we had wonderful conversations about life, family, what we think happens to us after this life, etc. I felt so honored that he was confiding in me some of his most personal thoughts and fears. I felt closer to him than I ever had before. We talked about how much he missed my mother who passed away a few years ago. We talked about how he hopes to be remembered. We just talked about life in general. 

Towards the end of the visit, he told me that he had his lawyer draw up papers making me his power of attorney and his healthcare power of attorney. He said I was the only one he trusted to always keep his best interest at heart. I'm the youngest of two children, so I assumed my older brother would be the one he would pick for this. 

I had gone to visit my elderly father, but when I left for home, I was leaving what felt like my best friend and confidant.",3,3
550,329,"Roughly two months ago I went through one of the most difficult events in my life. My younger brother was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Since it had spread, he was only given one month left to live. He was only 50 years old at the time. 

I received a call early in the morning from my nephew. He was in tears saying that his father was in the hospital over a diagnosis of lung cancer. I was in shock to hear this since I had only recently spoke to him a few months ago over the phone and he seemed fine. 

After arriving to the hospital, the doctor shared the news that he didn't have much longer to live. We cried and shared funny stories of our past. I made sure he was feeling comfortable. Since his chances of survival were so low, he refused chemotherapy. It just didn't make since given his prognosis. 

I helped him ensure his will was in order. He wanted to make sure I kept a close eye on his wife and son since he knew they would have a difficult time coping without him. 

And in the last weeks of his life, we made sure to spend as much time together as we possibly could - just enjoying ourselves like we used to when we were younger.",3,3
551,33,"I always knew as a young person that I want to make a difference. So even though my day job was marketing, I really saw my greater purpose to be driving business. So leading marketing or whatever it is that I've done throughout my career. I'm actually privileged right now to do what is really my passion. And that's really to lead change and changing some of the systems that have created some of the problems that we're unfortunately trying to resolve. 

In second grade, there was a teacher who had me come up and kept asking me to read, and I was reading all the stuff. And she was that teacher who said, wow this child here is special. And from there on I get placed in gifted classes and all this stuff, but my friends in my neighborhood were not in my classes. 

And when you get to high school, this gap continues. And so by the time we graduated, it wasn't until then, that I was the only student of color with the sash on for honors. The people were saying, you're smart? I was embarrassed to tell that story. 

Now in hindsight, I'm like, maybe I should have been telling my friends , maybe I should have been sharing the experiences. I could have played as a peer mentor to make sure more of my friends were having the same experience I had. 

And maybe I missed out when I was younger, but what I can do as I get older is to really address some of the inequities that do occur in education in particular.",2,2
552,330,"Waking up on my 48th birthday morning with the usual hangover. I woke realizing I needed a change, a new direction in life. Going sober for 30 days seemed like an easy undertaking, at least at first. 

Let the journey begin! Day 1 was inspiring, I visualized my future self as a sober successful and highly functioning human. Big announcements were made to all of my friends and family about this new undertaking, the new sober me. 

Day 2 - 5, this is easy being sober and slightly more functional. Motivation to work out kicked in around Day 6, which lasted until about Day 9. 

Day 10 - 15, I yearned for this new and improved sleep I was promised so early on in my quest for sobriety and it finally came. The deepest soundest sleep I have had in years, it felt amazing to wake up so tired because you slept so hard - I got this! 

Day 16 - 20, still sleeping and I guess I am a better functioning human. Still hate my job and only slightly more motivation to work out. 

Day 21, an invite to join friends at a bar - gulp! Could the new sober day me complete this test successfully? Yes, I did it! I went to a bar and woke up the next day feeling great - no hangover to plague me. 

Day 22 - 26, sleep is great, sleep is good but what about the higher functioning me? Have all of the years of almost daily drinking dulled my ability to be a higher functioning successful person? I only have 4 more days to figure this out, maybe it all clicks on day 30? 

The final 4 days were spent recapping this journey until it arrived, the big 3-0. I woke up that morning feeling nothing new or different, I am still the same me.",2,2
553,331,"I have spent the last year getting to know this one man. Within the last 6 months we have had a chance to get to know each other more. There have been some amazing ups and some heart aching downs. We are both emotional people that like to hide behind the confidence that we have in ourselves. 

It is refreshing when we both choose to be open and share how we really feel. A moment like that happened about four months ago. I was feeling down about my recent work experiences and slightly depressed due to memories of some past traumatic experiences. During this moment, he spent extra time with me doing simple things. We ate dinner together, watched movies at home and had long conversations. One night he stayed around and let me read a book to him. 

I really enjoyed his presence and appreciated the effort he put into assisting me to feel better. But I still was down. I am a bit of a nerd and enjoy technology. When he and I met I told him how I wished I had a laptop at home and internet connection and how it would make me happy. I guess he remembered after all those months. 

A month goes by of feeling down and out of the blue he suggest, ""Hey lets get you a laptop and I can provide internet connection."" I was shocked, that idea was not on my mind. When I am depressed I don't think much of what I can do to improve my life. I loved the idea and I felt as if the clouds in my rolled away and revealed sunshine. We decided on a laptop, split the cost and he provided me with a hot spot for internet service. 

I haven't felt depressed since the purchase. This may seem simple, but the internet is how I enjoy connecting the world and he showed me in his actions that he really understands me and that he does love me.",3,3
554,332,"Several weeks ago, my wife and I took our 3 sons to a park about an hour away from where we live. This park is in the middle of town and has a stream running through it with a rock bottom. Rock formations are all around the stream and numerous waterfalls are located in the stream throughout the park. 

This event was memorable and touching to me because it was the first time that we had all been out together as a family since our youngest son was born several weeks earlier. We have 3 sons aged 4, 20 months, and 4 weeks. Each of them had a different experience in the park. 

My oldest son had a great time by running upstream and jumping from the rocks into the water. My middle son also enjoyed himself by carefully walking through the water and commenting on the leaves he saw floating in the water or the small minnows he saw swimming. 

My youngest son is still too young to appreciate the experience but he was awake for the majority of the time while we were at the park. This event was also good for my wife who hadn't had much of a chance to get out of the house since our youngest son was born. 

The weather was warm but it was cooler in the shade where the stream was located. We also packed a picnic lunch that we enjoyed when our hiking through the stream was finished. 

Several weeks later, my two oldest sons are still talking about our experience at this park. I'm thankful for the time that we were able to spend together. I feel it's very valuable to get our kids outdoors as much as possible and let them play and exhaust some energy.",2,2
555,333,"My heart was broken. I don't know how to process this. I just received news today that E had passed. I am just so sad and numb. I can't believe she is gone. I am relieved for her but glad that she no longer has to be strong and brave. She can finally find peace. Selfishly, I wish she were still here. 

I can't help but reflect on the last year of emails and all the thoughts and memories that we shared. We learned we were more alike that I think each of us ever expected. We found joy and humor in same things. A good comedy, a book and always in pursuit of those foods that reminded us of childhood. 

I am flooded with memories and thoughts of her. She was creative and so smart. She was daring and bold. Fierce. 

My mind always goes back to when we were kids at our first swimming lesson. We were tasked with jumping in the water that well over heads. She was was first to go as I sat on edge with her sister, scared and nervous. When it was Edie's turn she bravely jumped in without hesitation. She immediately popped out of the water, with a big smile across her face. This gave me the courage to follow her lead. 

And through out our childhood as we came of age and tried new experiences she was like an older sister to me, even if it only by nine months. 

These are the thoughts that make me miss her feel nostalgic for a different time.I will always think of her fondly and miss her for all my days. I will find inspiration and remember how knowing her made me a better person.",3,3
556,335,"This last week, my Uncle died. He was my father's only brother, and my only ""blood"" uncle. We were not as close as some, but I had a great deal of respect for him. He was also the last of his generation. 

Obviously, I experienced personal loss and grief, and sorrow and sympathy for his three daughters (my only first cousins on that side of the family) and their children and grand children, but it goes beyond that. It indirectly signifies that my brothers and I are getting older. My brothers are in their 50s and I am 43. 

My Uncle's death makes me aware of our own aging, as now we are the oldest generation in our part of the family. Sometimes I still feel like a young man, but I am impelled by my Uncle's death to realize that not only am I firmly ensconced in middle age, but will be a senior before I know it. 

The swift march of the passage of time boggles me -- like they say the days crawl but the years fly. Additionally, it makes me aware of the larger ""circle of life"", if you'll pardon the phrase -- we're just another generation moving a slot in an unbroken chain. Others will come after. 

Eventually, I will be in my 70s, 80s, and then it will be my time to pass. So not only am I filled with sorrow and sympathy, but I am very aware of the passage of time. My own aging and mortality are very apparent.",3,3
557,336,"Last May, I celebrated my fortieth birthday with my family and two other families. We gathered at the lake in Kentucky where we meet every May. We spent three days fishing, boating, and socializing. It was great to hear from old friends who we do not see often anymore. All of the adults were very close in college, but have drifted apart in the recent years moving to different states. 

It was important to me because while I enjoy meeting with my two best friends from college, our families have now started to grow closer as well. Each family has two children, and I enjoyed seeing my daughters become closer friends with the other children. The children planned their own games, enjoyed swimming in the lake, and created a rope-swing off of the dock. 

The most meaningful moments to me were seeing our children develop a similar friendship to what I had with the two other Dads who were present that weekend. The children wanted to keep in contact upon leaving, which has not happened before. They planned to ""borrow"" phones from their parents so that they could text and call each other throughout the summer. They even planned another trip for the three families to an amusement part later this fall. 

The children are now growing old enough that they can experience lake activities without the adults, giving us more time for reflection and fun. The fact the the weekend hit a milestone birthday for me this year was largely a coincidence, but it worked out perfectly as a time to reflect on four decades and anticipate (hopefully) many more. It is great to know that some friendships span multiple generations.",2,2
558,337,"I remember this one day back in high school. I had just finished my last year of school, in a brand new area since my father had us move for work. I was really sad about a friend I had, because she said she was moving away the day that school ended. I was so distraught I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her, since it was too painful for me to remember how I would never see her again. 

I ended up bolting out of my last class and heading to the local market, where I bought a maple bar and coffee. Maple bars and coffee ended up being a ritual of sorts for me after that day. I bought a 20 dollar store card at that same market and redeemed it for a video game, which I played for an hour before breaking down in tears. I wished at the time things were different, that I didn't have her leave my life. I was certain, at least at the time, that I had met someone very special to me. 

Fast forward a couple of years, and I no longer speak to her. Part of me wishes that I kept in touch, but I realize now that people have to move on. No matter how painful or uncomfortable it may be. I still drink coffee and eat donuts from time to time, but I've stopped for the most part. I try to be healthier, even if it seems like it is an effort that goes unnoticed. I wish her the best.",3,3
559,339,"My wedding day was at the beggining of the year and though it wasnt all that i expected it was still a nice day and one that i will always remember. We got married in the court house that my husband worked on while he was roofing. My grandparents were the only ones able to come. They waited in the lobby with our youngest son who was just 2 months at the time while we took our 5 year old upstairs with us for the ceremony. 

It was short and simple. I wish that more family could have come to share the day with us but it was special and will be something to beat when we get our vows renewed in the future. When I was younger I did imagine me to at least have a nice white dress and a bridesmaid in a church. The fact that it wasnt in a church did bother me a little, and i wore a regular but nice red dress i got on sale for $40. 

I would have loved to have flowers because my husband always brings me red roses. Being that it was in between our birthdays will be nice for a anniversary. I am thankful that my kids were there. I am thankful that my grandparents were present. I am thankful to be able to legally marry my husband. And I am thankful that it was a nice day. 

In the future I will be thankful.",2,2
560,34,"Generally, the schools that we work in are pretty negative environments. Our students grow up in homes where they don't necessarily get a chance to learn proper anger management techniques. And so you see a lot of students who get in fights. Or they throw something so that they can get suspended. Or they do something so that they don't have to be there. 

There's usually something behind that, whether it's they don't feel they are able to succeed. Whether it's they're afraid of what might happen if they do succeed. Whether it's afraid that they are just unable to grasp a concept, so it's kind of sad , but there's always a bright light. 

City here is there to find those bright lights and make them brighter. We work with kids in attendance, behavior, and course performance, in English and math. And our numbers show it, where at the beginning of the year there's so many suspensions, so many fights , and then by the end of the year those are all decreased. 

We had these little catchphrases that people throw around, and one of them is, this is hard, be strong. Find something that they do know how to do. Find something that they do like to do, and build that relationship on that. 

I know that what I do right now is very important. And I'm influencing a student everyday. Every student can succeed, we just need to find the right way to make that happen.",2,2
561,340,"I was hiking near Lake Ontario with my partner and our two grandkids. It was a beautiful sunny day. The lake sparkled brilliantly. I have a bad knee, so I was struggling with some of the physical activity. My partner suggested that I rest a bit on a fallen log. I was nervous, because I would not be able to get up by myself, but I agreed. 

My partner and my granddaugther wanted to hike further to see the bluffs. I said I would be OK for a bit, but my sweet grandson insisted on staying with me. He said, ""I won't let my granny sit in the forest all alone."" 

Well it was a good thing. My partner and granddaughter didn't return in a reasonable amount of time. We got very nervous! My grandson is 10 years old, but not strong enough to help me up. He searched for a stout walking stick and found one nearby. I used it to prop myself up, and managed to get my feet underneath me. 

Together we went down the shore to find the rest of our party. Luckily all was well, but I would truly have been distraught if I had been all alone waiting for so long!",3,3
562,341,"A couple of months ago, I applied for a job working with special needs children. I needed income for the summer, so I applied to as many jobs as I could. I had not received many phone calls back regarding my applications. This particular job I applied for, I was not necessarily qualified to do. During the school year, I had a job working with children but I had no experience working with special needs children. This job also required a special certification which I did not possess. I applied anyways. 

Two weeks later I got an email from the company requesting a time to set up a phone screening. I passed the phone screening and got an interview. I was not able to prepare for the interview much, and expected to bomb it. I was nervous and unorganized before the interview and decided to just wing it. 

I did the interview. The questions were hard, but I think I did a good job answering most of them. There were a couple of questions that I think I messed upon. At the end of the interview, I was hired on the spot. I couldn't believe it! 

I thanked the interviewer and completed the paperwork for new employees. I never got a job so easily. It made me believe more in myself and what I had to offer.",2,2
563,342,"Recently my oldest daughter graduated high school and is starting college. This is all new to me, and it came at me like a freight train. There was so much growing up done in the last two months, I barely recognized my little girl. I was planning parties, and attending parties, and getting finances in order, and trying to be happy all at the same time. I thought I was ready for her to be an ""adult"". I realized quickly that I wasn't. 

It's hard to watch your kids grow. It makes you think back to all the people you wanted in your life to see this, that aren't with you anymore. It is the most crazy time in my life. I think back and the first day of kindergarten wasn't that long ago, was it? 

We had a great grad party, all her friends were here. We had all of our family over. We ordered so much food, and the biggest cake ever. We all had such a great time. I realized then, that she was growing up, and that her friends weren't really ""kids"" anymore either. 

It wasn't soon after the grad party that she was already getting her things in order to start college. I will admit that a little part of me is glad that she is going to college locally and staying at home. It's nice to keep them as long as you can. 

She's been in college for two weeks now. Stress is real to her now, and to me. I think we have both done some growing up and realizations have occurred that we are moving on in life together, just in different ways. And it's harder for some of us to do it gracefully, but we do our best.",3,3
564,343,"I took a trip for work that included a close friend. The trip was for a conference, but we chose to stay over a couple days, and she brought her daughter along for the trip as well. Overall, the trip went ok, but there were reminders of why our friendship was strained. 

While I do still care about her, and I believe she still cares about me, the trip cemented the idea that we're basically at a point of the friendship ending. While spending time together was nice, there was an air of separation , and almost a wall between us. It's easy to understand why. The fact that we attempted a romantic relationship that failed and tried to keep everything normal worked a while, but we can't keep that up forever. So we're now in a situation where we're close but divided, being friends for 15 years can't just be cut off, but its almost like it stops now, and we just get to share the past. 

We got to experience Washington DC together, but I don't think it will ever be ""our"" trip, but rather a trip we both went on. I'll at least have the memories of the museums and memorials for myself. 

In terms of things that happened, we had many periods of silence while even being in the same room, and at times it seems she didn't want to be around me. As I could, I would go do my own thing so she wasn't getting upset, but it was painful to do so. Realizing you're not wanted isn't a fun experience. There was never a situation where she said I needed to go away, but it was made uncomfortable by the way she acted. 

It's hopefully something that will heal with time, but I don't know that it will. It's causing me to look into new jobs so that I can remove myself from the situation.",3,3
565,344,"I experienced the death of my two in laws and my dad within the last six months. It was totally unexpected and it just came so suddenly. All three of them were in fair health condition before, but their health suddenly deteriorated so badly that led to their death. 

I felt so hopeless and unprepared. It seemed like we just talked not too long ago, but suddenly you just could not see the person again forever! Having someone so close to you pass away made you sad and rethink the meaning of life. 

What is most important? What would you want to do if this is your last moment? We just cannot waste time on trivial things, because we can die any moment! It doesn't matter whether you are old or young. Life is really short and unexpected, and we need to cherish every moment of it. 

I want to spend more time with my loved ones, and make more memories. Also, I want to go with my heart and do what I like. Stop complaining and just act! You never know when your last moment will come, and hopefully, I live to the fullest of life before the end of it.",3,3
566,345,"Growing up in a small town is fun but it also has limits. I knew that if I ever wanted to make something of myself I would need to leave home and find my footing. My step father signed me up for college and I didn't have a choice so I went. It was a huge cultural shock but one of the highlights of my life. I made it through 5 years of college with only a little change in my pocket. 

I never knew that I could be proud of myself but when they handed me my diploma and everyone cheered I knew at the moment that I did something worthy. Going through high school was required but completing college was determination. I knew that I had done something to better my family and my future. 

We ended up eating at a restaurant when the graduation was over and my family gave truly emotional toasts in my honor. Even though their words were kind and inspiring I did not need them this time. I was actually proud of myself and what I had accomplished through hard work. I even interviewed for a teaching job a week later and was employed. 

We all face hardships but it's about determination and resilience. I knew I wanted to make a bigger impact on the world. I hope that I impact my students lives like others did for me.",2,2
567,346,"This past April, I believed I was in line for a big promotion at work. I had been training very hard, and my boss had hinted I would be the one to receive this promotion. I was very excited about the prospect because the position not only came with a private office, but also including a great pay raise. I had even gone so far as to tell my parents how excited I was. 

However, on the day I should have received the job, no email from our upper management team ever came. I stayed calm at first, but as the next day saw no communication too, I began to worry. I had been banking on the new job for a while. I tried to reassure myself that maybe they had just made a mistake or were busy. 

As I tried to calm myself down, I began to hear loud voices from another side of the office. People were congratulating a coworker. The feeling hit me a lightning bolt. They had given the job to someone else. I remember being very confused and jealous at first. My statistics were the best in the office. It should have been me. I felt lied to by my manager. 

The most memorable part was hearing all of the congratulations which should have been for me. I am still trying to not let this get to me and it has been several months.",3,3
568,347,"My daughter and her husband were excited to announce this spring that they were expecting their second child. As a proud grandmother who provides daycare during the week for their first child, I was naturally thrilled. 

My daughter is a special education teacher. She was very fortunate to have the summer months off from teaching while she was experiencing the tiredness and nausea that early pregnancy brings. 

While on a weekend camping trip at the Missouri River several weeks ago, my daughter was frightened to discover that she was passing some blood. Her husband rushed her to the emergency room at the closest community. 

They were immediately assisted by the on-call physician. He performed an examination and lab work and called in the on-call ultrasound technician. They were relieved to learn that she was not experiencing a miscarriage. 

However, they were shocked to hear that ""BOTH"" babies appeared to be doing well and had good strong heartbeats! What a change in emotions! We all shifted from fear of the worst to the joy of upcoming TWINS! 

We are all feeling blessed with the good news. I am now preparing for the upcoming role as a grandma daycare provide of twin babies and a two-year-old! 

Our family is so blessed with our exciting news. We can hardly wait to learn the genders of the twins so that we can begin preparing for their arrival.",3,3
569,348,"I was helping my dad tow a trailer manually with a toll dolly. When he asked me to back it up a bit, as I was turning around the weight of the trailer threw the dolly towards the trailer and sent me flying. As I was falling, my head hit the trailer hard. As I fell on the ground, I instantly knew I had broke my arm. My Mom called 9-1-1 while the pain I felt equaled child birth or kidney stones! 

Finally the ambulance arrived. On the ride in, every bump he hit caused so much pain! The ER did an incredible job. First I had an MRI to check on the extent of my head injury. Then they x-ray'd my arm. That was tough because I didn't want the technicians to touch my arm but they did an outstanding job. 

Finally the doctor came in and said I had sustained a catastrophic injury. Both my ulna and radial bones in my right arm had snapped in half! I couldn't believe it. I had absolutely no support in my arm. He said Slocum Orthopedic would be calling me the next day as I would need surgery. He also put two staples in my head and home I went. 

Needless to say, I didn't sleep that well. At 7:30am the next morning, I received a call from Slocum. They wanted me in to see the doctor at 10:05am. My friend came and drove me into the appointment. I found myself laying in the operating room having surgery at 2:15pm that day. 

Now began the process of rehab and getting full use of my dominant arm back.",3,3
570,349,"One of my favorite bands was coming to play in a city about 2 hours away. I don't really enjoy travel due to the traffic and stress but decided that I would go to see my favorite band. I immediately purchased the tickets when I was able to get them on presale and I also purchased special parking. As the day of the concert slowly approached I became anxious about the travel. I started thinking that maybe I should just sell the tickets since it was a sold out show. In the end, I decided against it. 

On the day of the concert I was the one to drive the whole way there, including to a restaurant in the heart of the city. I was pleased I'd made it that far without a large amount of stress. From the restaurant my partner drove us to the concert. We had fast pass so got inside with a shorter line. It was a pleasant day for an outdoor concert and we even had lawn chairs provided by the venue. 

The concert and evening was better than expected even though my partner was cranky about their seating arrangement. It was a wonderful night in a good setting, even though the 22 year old in front of me was drunk and obnoxious the whole concert. The group I was going to see surpassed how I thought they would perform live. Even my partner who didn't really like or dislike the band commented on what a good show it was. 

Even now reminiscing I'm pleased I changed my mind and went. And looking back, even though we got unnecessarily lost on the way home and fought regarding that, (when I wasn't driving), the concert itself was worth it.",2,2
571,350,"Three weeks ago I took a trip to Budapest, Hungary with one of my childhood best friends. I was already in Europe because I had been working in Madrid, Spain. I took a short flight, and met my friend in Hungary. She was pretty jet lagged since she came from the United States but we went out for dinner that night. We were absolutely blown away with how delicious Hungarian food is. We had delicious stew and soup. I was worried initially about how the food would be. I do not eat meat, and I read prior that Hungarians love their meat, but I had no trouble finding vegetarian options. 

The next day on our trip, we saw the beautiful Parliament building, and a beautiful castle. I remember walking up many stairs and getting tired in the hot, summer sun. Suddenly though, we reached an archway that took us to the end of the tunnel. There was sunlight peaking through and some of the most beautiful architecture I had ever seen. I saw beautiful mosaics, and a cobblestone square that overlooked the entire city of Budapest. Perfectly situated was a bar where we could sit down and look out at the view of the city and parliament building on the other side of the water. It was absolutely breathtaking and my favorite part of the trip. 

A close second for my favorite part of the trip was a sunset boat ride we took that allowed us to later see the lit up buildings at night. We finished our last day of the trip with going to the famous baths. It was perfect timing to relax after having walked many miles the days before. The baths are said to have healing qualities, but regardless, I found them very relaxing. 

This trip was amazing overall, I really enjoyed sharing an international experience with one of my best friends. I hadn't seen her for almost a year so it was really great to catch up and kind of share with her a little bit of my chaotic life of when I was working in Europe.",2,2
572,351,"Recently, I went to a party celebrating my grandparents' 50th anniversary. I was expecting my immediate family, my grandparents, and a few others since not many family members were in town that I was aware of. However, when I reached the location of the party, I came to realize that it was more of a surprise party for them, and all of my aunts and uncles had traveled to attend! I was shocked to see so many family members there, and they were all excited to see me. 

With the festivities commenced, I went to go talk to some of my cousins that had all traveled a decent distance to be there. I learned that one of my cousins was going to move closer to my grandparents since they needed more immediate help (my grandpa was struggling with Alzheimer's). He told me that my grandparents had shown lots of signs of needing help and offered to be a help when a family council was called with all my aunts and uncles. That was definitely a surprisingly development! 

The party itself was great and well planned. There was a slideshow to help everyone remember all the awesome moments of my grandparents lives and what they had done for the world. They showed that my grandpa used to serve in the marines and would have to leave for long stretches of time to fulfill those assignments. 

Most surprisingly, they had a scavenger hunt prepared that had some of the littler children go around the house and ""discover"" hidden clues that revealed more about my grandparent's lives. They were thrilled to participate and added to the fun of the party. 

After all was said and done, the family did a great job of preparing the party and showing my grandparents that they care. There was a lot of work that needed to get done with their advancing age, but it was great to participate and see so many familiar faces.",2,2
573,352,"It was my 30th birthday and I didn't really think much of it. I woke up at about 9:30 AM in the morning and my mother handed me a birthday card. On the card it said, ""I have an amazing son... who knows who he is and what he wants. Tells it like it is and lives his own truth."" The guitar had a bright red guitar logo on it. I felt that this meant a lot to me since I love rock and playing guitar. My mother put a lot of thought into this card and knew exactly what I wanted. It made me feel very motivated. I felt very appreciative of this card. 

Following that she took me to the movies to go see Godzilla. I felt very appreciative of this, because Godzilla is one of my favorite franchises. She even bought me popcorn. Though, initially the popcorn was stale a fact I bought up to her she suggested that I go and get another bowl. I went to get a fresh bowl of popcorn made and it was delicious. It was warm and buttery. 

After we finished watching the movie I thought that it was alright and decent. My mother liked it a little more than I did surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters, there isn't much human characters can do and also a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat. A lot of the characters in the movie felt pointless and unnecessary. 

Following that she took me to go and get some Indian food. I really appreciated that, because Indian cuisine is my favorite. The food that day was particularly delicious. I had a short conversation with some people next to me, but I don't really think my intrusion into their conversation was all that welcomed. 

It was a fun day all and all and I had a lot of appreciation for my mother and her taking me to the movies.",2,2
574,353,"I was estranged from my extended family for a long time. We have recently started to spend time together again. My birthday was in June. Traditionally, I would spend my birthday with my mother. We would go to a movie, and then out to eat, and we would end the day with birthday cake. Since my mother died two years ago, my birthday has been very sad. 

But this year, I invited her sister and brother to share the day with me. We went to see The Secret Life of Pets 2, which we all enjoyed. We had a nice lunch out together. And then we came back to my house for birthday cake. 

They really made the day special and memorable for me. If I couldn't spend it with my mom, at least I could spend it with people who loved her as much as I did. We had such a good time that day that we decided to re-start some old family traditions that I remember from my childhood. 

Since then we have also celebrated my uncle's birthday and had a great time that day too. We are making plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am happy that my birthday celebration was the beginning of healing old rifts in my family.",2,2
575,354,"About 6 months ago I was tasked with finding a way back to school for spring semester. Coming off of fall break, I was struggling to find money for a train ticket. Luckily the dilemma was short lived. Because of my supporting family and friends they came up with a way to help me. With the support of family and close friends, they helped out tremendously. I was able to get back to school to finish out my spring semester with great grades. 

The lessons learned is saving money and looking into fares ahead of time as they are cheaper. People will pay a premium for train tickets if they purchase them late. 

Another lesson learned is to always have a strong support system. In addition to having a strong support system, it reminds me to never forget those whom helped me. Paying it forward is an important part of my journey in life. 

Keeping in mind a philosophy of interdependence, we all owe one another. I do my very best to dedicate my time and efforts to helping others. One day those same people you have helped will be in a position to help you. 

In saying that, always do good unto other people as you will one day need it.",1,1
576,355,"Last month my neighbor decided to park between his garage and my house on part of my lawn. His truck is huge and completely blocks my window. The only window that I have that is able to be opened. My cat tree sits in front of it. The cats look out it and look a birds or other things going on there. 

When I asked him about parking there he kind of shrugged it off and let me know he had no intention of not parking there anymore. So I made a decision to go buy a birdbath and put it in front of that window on my area of property. 

I purchased the birdbath. It was huge. Weighed about 100lbs. I killed my back lifting it into the cart. I hurt my back so badly I could not get it out of the cart and into my car. I had to have someone from the store do it for me. 

I asked my neighbor to please move his truck sometime that week so that I could install the birdbath. He got furious, started going off about property lines and blah blah blah. I remained calmed and I showed him the property line and said nicely, didnt mean to upset you, I just want to install a birdbath on my property in front of my cat window. 

So with the help of my roommates walker with a seat on it, I was able to move the heavy birdbath from car to where I was putting it in. I was suprised at how smoothly that went. I now have a nice birdbath, and no huge monsterous truck blocking my window, the birds have water and my cats have more things to watch.",2,2
577,356,"At the age of 11, I was diagnosed with a chronic disease called Type 1 Diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes is when the autoimmune system attacks the pancreas and destroys the pancreas' ability to regulate blood sugar. Due to this, a Type 1 Diabetic has to inject insulin everyday in order to live. 

Unfortunately, while you can do a good job managing your blood sugars using insulin, you simply can't compare to a fully functioning pancreas and problems will occur as a result. 

In May, I was at home on a Saturday cooking dinner. I was having brown rice and baked chicken breasts. Due to the carbohydrates that are in rice, I had to take insulin in order for my body to process the brown rice. I took my insulin around 20 minutes before I ate. I planned to eat a lot (for me) of brown rice that evening so I took a much larger than normal dose of insulin. 

After I prepared my food, I sat down and began to eat my chicken breasts first. I tried a special barbecue sauce on the chicken breasts and they tasted wonderful. I had no problems devouring the chicken breasts. 

After I finished the chicken breast, I started to eat the brown rice. However, I started to feel extremely and uncomfortably full to the point where I became nauseated. Unfortunately, at that time the insulin that I took for the brown rice started to kick in some my blood sugar dropped down to dangerously low levels. 

I tried to eat the rice to get my blood sugar back up, but I was so full that I couldn't do it. At that time, the effects of low blood sugar were kicking in. I was sweating heavily and shaking. I had trouble moving. My ability to think and problem solve took a huge hit. 

I was slowly wandering around my apartment looking for something that I could eat that wouldn't cause me to vomit which would make it even harder to get my blood sugar back up. That's when I found some Powerbar Energy Gels that I use when I exercise. They weren't heavy on your stomach and they have a lot of carbohydrates which would counteract the insulin. I downed a few packets of the gels and in 20-25 minutes I started to feel better. 

I had survived, but it is a situation that still scares me to this day.",3,3
578,357,"The most memorable and recent event that I can remember that happened to me was when we took a trip to New York City. I was excited and looking forward to the event. I was with my niece, my sister and my significant other. We took a car going in the city and the car ride in itself was fun. We got to see a lot of people, shops and interesting city life along the way. 

When we got to Times Square, we took a lot of pictures. We were surprised at the sea of of people. People from all over the world. I could hear different languages spoken everywhere. We also got to see a group of Eagle Scouts from Germany chanting the Eagle Scout pledge in German. I could hear faint whispers of Japanese. And on the other side of the street you can hear a group of friends talking in Korean. 

We started trekking the whole street of Times Square. There were a lot of tourist-y shops around. We went inside a shop that was filled with a lot of young tourists. We were curious so we went in and checked it out. It was a shop called BTS21. There were a lot of cute stuffed toys, apparel and cute knick knacks that appeal to young people. My niece was so excited that she bought a lot of stuffed toys. I tried to calm myself down in order not to spend a lot in the store. 

When we had filled ourselves with cuteness overload, we stopped by a hotdog stand and got ourselves hotdogs. New York natives call this dirty dogs. I was curious as to how it got it's nickname. It turns out the hotdogs are cooked in a vat of hot water with some seasonings and stays in there until a customer buys one. It gets scooped up from the hot vat of water, put in a bun and gets added with either ketchup or mustard. 

It was a fun experience for me,",2,2
579,358,"On May 18th of 2019 my grandmother unexpectedly passed away. She passed away during the night. She passed away in her sleep. The official cause of death was listed as a major heart attack. 

My grandmother and father both lived on their own at the time this happened. Both my father and grandmother were disabled and I am their primary caregiver. This event was very traumatic to my family. My grandmother was a very influential and important part of our family. My grandmother was the matriarch of the family. 

The day that it happened my father knocked on my door in the morning and woke me and told me that my grandmother was gone. I immediately jumped out of bed. The paramedics has just taken her in an ambulance to the hospital while trying to resuscitate her. My father was totally devastated by this event. He was hurt and emotional and crying over the passing of his mother. 

I tried to do my best to console him while also handling all of the funeral expenses and requirements. We had to call and notify all of our other family members about her passing away as well. It was a very difficult and emotional experience for our family. Funerals are very expensive and there is not a lot of financial help available to people out there. 

I now urge everyone I know to have life insurance and a will to help simplify this process and reduce stress on the family members.",3,3
580,360,"In the past six months, things have changed so much. I have lost so much respect for so many people, and gained that respect for others. I have lost the love of my life, only to have them come back into my life. 

Not talking to this person was the most mentally handicapping thing, and physically destroying thing I've ever been through. But recently things have gotten better after their return, I feel much better as of late. Things are starting to improve as I grow with this person and begin to trust them again. 

It's very hard to go through losing someone so vital to your life. I never thought I would see them again, nor hear from them again. And that was mentally challenging thing ever. 

Knowing they knew the most about me, and how to help when I was mentally gone was harsh. I didn't know what to do without them. They taught me coping mechanisms and how to handle myself. 

Being alone during that time lead me down a very dark path. I relapsed in a lot of things I shouldn't have, and I think that's one of my biggest regrets. I'm so happy I have this person back again.",3,3
581,362,"My college roommate, Pat moved back to my hometown after living in NYC for a decade or so because his mother was in very poor health. L., his mother, was suffering from some sort of neuro-degenerative disorder that left her confined to a wheelchair with limbs curled into tight knots. L. was very active in my life during our college years. She'd have Pat and I over for dinner every month or so. And I got to know and love her greatly. 

L. passed away last month after battling her condition for years. It was time for her to go, and I'm sure that everyone was greatly relieved to have an end to her great suffering. 

Well it just so happens that I'd been planning a trip with my friend Brian to visit another friend Ashley and his family who'd moved last year to Colorado for work. It'd taken us a long time to find a time that would work for our schedules, and we booked the non-refundable tickets and paid the deposit on our Air bnb. 

Of course the funeral happened to occur on the very day we were to leave. When I found out, I was distraught. I don't know why it hit me so hard. I just felt like a heel. I thought of cancelling my trip. I probably should have, but I spoke with Pat and Brian and Ashley, and everyone said I shouldn't change my plans. 

The only balm was that I was able to attend the visitation that happened the night before our trip. And my lovely wife attended the funeral in my place. I still feel guilty about it though.",3,3
582,363,"2 months ago i was barely scraping by financially. i was making just enough money at work to pay my bills and eat, but not much else. i didn't even have the ability to put money away in case something bad were to happen to me. if i got sick and was unable to work, everything would have been over for me. 

But as luck would have it i actually got a raise in my pay. And no small raise either. I was put on as head of a major project at work and was compensated accordingly. 

I remember when the news broke about me being placed on the project, I went home and just cried tears of joy because it felt like my career was finally going where I wanted it to go. I called my parents and gave them the good news. They were excited for me because they knew how much it meant to me. They were also happy I was finally being paid like I deserved to be. 

As soon as I got my first check since becoming the project head I took the money and paid off all my remaining debt. I even had some left over to put into savings. I felt like I didn't have to compromise in my career to earn good money. I was proud of myself more than I had ever been before.",3,3
583,364,"On the 6th of June 2019, my elder sister and I had a fight. I had to leave the house early in the morning and at the time I left, she was not awake. Usually when I'm leaving the house the house, I tell her, since she needs the key to get into the main house. My sister lives in our outhouse, and she usually comes to the main house to do some things. I think, since I'm not certain, that was the first reason that annoyed her, which ultimately led to the fight. 

Another thing was that as I was leaving the house, I ate a bit of her food before I left, since I knew I had a long day ahead of me. When I got to work, my sister called me, but I didn't pick the call. Thus, this all accumulated to make my sister angry. 

As I was coming home from work that day, I was also a bit agitated because I was not able to get home early due to traffic, but my sister did not go to work. When I came home she asked me a question about both the food and not telling her when I left the house which I answered in a snobbish manner. She then asked another question which I didn't respond to this time. After that, she then took offence and started to get angry, but as I was also angry things escalated quickly. 

Careless words were said by both parties and it nearly turned into a dire situation . Thankfully the intervention of my other elder sister stopped things. I must say things were sour between the two of us for about 2 weeks due to the fight. All is well between us now though.",2,2
584,365,"My daughter moved into a small house on my property. This event happened two weeks ago. I am very happy about it and have done a lot to help this work out for her. My daughter is out of college with a career as a massage therapist for cancer patients. She is just getting going in her career and so doesn't have much money saved. She has found a boyfriend she likes and he is going to live in her house as well. 

This directly involves me because I worked out the plan for her to come live here. I helped her with her credit and helped her physically move her furniture. Most importantly I helped her decide it was the right thing to do, to live next to her mother and younger sister. 

The reason this is my story, is because I have recently been diagnosed with lung cancer. This is terrifying to me because I might die. It is also scary because my wife is a stay at home mother with our vaccine injured daughter. I have no life insurance because I am a smoker. 

If I do die, my daughter will need her sister and mother to help finish raising her. Family is everything and I know my wife will need the support emotionally, of her older daughter, if I die and leave her alone. This is devastating for the entire family. Arranging to have my older daughter live nearby gives me great comfort in these dark days.",3,3
585,366,"I live on a fixed income and it's not a lot but it's enough if I'm careful about my spending so to make sure I don't accidentally leave myself short I always keep money for necessities in the bank and for non-necessities at home. It prevents me from impulse shopping. 

I double checked my bank account balance just before heading out to get cat food today. It's the last necessity for the month and as expected, I had just enough so I left the house with nothing but my card and a few dollars in change. 

My card was declined twice. I asked the cashier to hang onto my stuff for a few minutes so I could step outside and call my bank to sort it out. It turns out that only moments before, my bank withdrew my monthly fees. They were a week early so I wasn't impressed but I still had enough if I used the change I had. 

It was a pain in the ass but not a financial crisis so I headed back in and stood in line again. A woman who was just finishing up at the cash walked to the back of the line and handed me my purchase with a smile and said she'd already taken care of it. 

I thought I was going to cry. I've had a really rough week dealing with PTSD flashbacks and this lady touched me hard in the feels. I let her know I got the problem sorted out and could pay for it but she declined so I said ""Well, thank you! That was very sweet. If I can't pay it back, I guess I'll just have to pay it forward."" She made my day. 

Next time I'm out, I'll make someone else's day.",3,3
586,367,"In August of 2019 I visited friends in detroit. They were friends that I've had for several years, but this was the first time we would be meeting in person. We met playing League of Legends online, and we are all fans of the professional scene of that game as well. So when finals were going to be hosted in Detroit it seemed like a perfect time to visit both my friends, and also go see this event I've loved so much live. 

We went to Little Ceasers arena and got to watch one of our favorite teams battle it out against the top team in North America. I don't go to a lot of sporting events so it was novel for me to get swept up in a cheering crowd or scream when something awesome happened on stage. Unfortunately they lost but the games were close. My favorite moment was getting to hear one of my favorite songs live and hear the stadium hum and sing along to it. 

Although a close second was getting to go backstage. We didn't get to meet any of the professional players, but we got to meet the tour manager. Backstage was amazing to see, they basically had to set up a whole home office just for a weekend. 

Besides just the event, I got to play games with my friends in person and hang out in their houses, and I loved every moment of it. I also brought my dog with because I talk to him constantly while I'm in a call with my friends so it felt right that they would finally get to meet him. 

The drive there and back was long, about 12 hours both ways. But I didn't mind it because I listened to podcasts the whole way. I did make the mistake of listening to a murder podcast just as it was getting dark, so that actually did make me a little anxious.",2,2
587,368,"Last May I was forced to quit my 5 years old job. the first week of December I trusted one of my coworker to help me out with an important project for the university, but in that project we had to deal with money. She was stealing money and I didn't realize it. 

Once the project was half way I had to request more money because we were out of it, and the way she explained to me was very convincing at that moment. The accounting department started to investigate, it was not at all clear. There were missing money from that project and some others as well. 

Even though I had nothing to do with it, it was not the first time, so they said they need to let me go. I had no more option than quitting my job. I was sad and depressed for about 4 weeks. I was constantly blaming myself for what happened. Those were the worst weeks of my life. 

I finally understood it was not my fault and things happened for a reason. I got another job almost as good as that one. I have been more careful with people and projects. I haven't been able to trust people like I used to.",3,3
588,369,"It was a cold Chicago night in January, nearly 40 degrees below zero. This was an important night because I was taking an important prospective client out to dinner. The location was one of the most expensive steakhouses in the city. Dinner was set to start at 6pm, and the prospect, a CEO of a prominent area hospital had ensured the restaurant staff would take care of us while we awaited his arrival. 

The meal was nothing short of magical, the filet mignon was impeccable, and the sides and cocktails were masterfully created. As dinner progressed, the conversation veered towards business, and we talked in depth about his hospital and the challenges he is facing. Our value proposition was strong. The CEO was impressed with what we were able to bring to the table. 

We opted to skip dessert, but agreed to set up time for a meeting in the days to come. After saying our goodbyes, my two coworkers and I went to the bar to celebrate what was expected to be a highly lucrative deal. Our Old Fashions had never tasted better, and we decided to grab another table near the bar since our company was footing the bill. 

At the table next to ours, two beautiful women overheard us discussing hospital strategy and interjected themselves, they were doctors at another prestigious hospital nearby. The night progressed, and the 5 of us went on to another bar. The rest, as they say, is history. 

6 months later, one of those girls is now my girlfriend, and the CEO is a happy client of ours.",2,2
589,370,"I was saving up money to go to a concert with my brother in law. I saw tickets for a band I had wanted to see and was a fan of for years. It was right there I knew that we were going to drive up and make it happen. Some of the music of this band highlighted my teenage years and I never had time to go to shows because of demands of work and monetary reasons. 

We set out to get floor seat tickets and I was actually intrigued by where the concert was taking place. The ride up to Nebraska wasn't that bad and we got to see a lot of corn fields and stuff I haven't seen in a while. There was a lot to look forward to once we arrived at the hotel. There were some decent restaurants around and we took a chance on a pizza place which turned out to be great. Afterwards, we headed to the venue which was a good sized arena. I was happy that there was so many people that came together. 

I had been waiting awhile to get to see some of my favorite bands leave behind an awesome experience. After a couple beers, we went inside and prepared to go in. I had never been in the mosh pit before and was looking forward to it. The first band played which was Behemoth and they rocked it. My shoulder got hit, but I popped it back into place. Gojira then went on and made an impact with their aggressive, but powerful songs. 

I enjoyed a little bit of Volbeat which is another hard rock type of band that has catchy songs. Then the best of all, Slipknot was due to go on after a good break. The intensity of the intro they play off their second album was immense. I pretty much lost my voice and was sweating from jumping the whole time. It was more than I imagined and they delivered one of the most energetic sets I have ever seen at a show. 

They then played one of their new songs which I wasn't expecting and I was a bit emotional about it. It hit home that I got to see Slipknot for the first time ever and I'd never forget how much they gave back to us fans.",3,3
590,371,"On July 4th, I was admitted to Kaiser Hospital in Los Angeles while suffering what turned out to be a heart attack. It had begun the previous day and the uncomfortable feeling just didn't go away. At 3:30 AM, I drove from the San Gabriel Valley to the facility, about 15 miles away. My friends still think I was nuts and my family agreed, saying that this apple did not fall far from its tree, seeing that my dad did the same thing when he had his heart attack at 65. 

While at the emergency ward, I began to get suspicious and came up with this conclusion: the more different doctors visit you in a two hour period, the more serious the condition. For the next few hours, I was prodded, tested and sent to another hospital where two stents were inserted to make the ""widow maker"" work better (it was 90% blocked). Within a few days, I was released. 

However, the world I knew for 61 years changed with those three days. Probably the greatest challenge wasn't so much the junk food that consumed this average baby boomer so much as the time I had to take to make that work. Seasoning food without salt takes creativity. Substituting fruits and whole wheat involves careful planning at a store. If i eat out, I have to check the menu more carefully to eliminate anything with too much sodium, or with processed sugar. In short, this new diet demands attentitveness, something I ignored when it came to health, but didn't when it came to work. 

I'm not through though. In a few weeks, I have to meet with a cardiac surgeon. Yeah, bypass. That means a few months recovery at a time where I don't think I have the strength or resources to fully get back on my feet. But I have friends and family and my own tenacity. I can prepare a salmon, I can rise up from however many bypasses they have to put in.",3,3
591,372,"I went to visit family for vacation at my sister's house. It was the first time in years that we had all gathered together and some of the younger children had never met before. It was a great time watching them all play together and get along. 

I helped with a lot of the cooking as I like that and am good at it. It was fun to go out in the woods with the kids and show them the river and we saw a deer. I played baseball with a few of the nephews. We went out to eat at a great restaraunt and had a great time.

It was nice to catch up with my siblings and hang out like we used to. We had not all been together for a long time and we reminisced. It was a bit cold but did not snow and we built a fire outside one night and maybe drank a bit much. My parents enjoyed seeing all of the kids running around. 

It was a great time with my family and one we will repeat this year. We discussed renting a nice lake house or something a bit closer to everybody next time. It is hard to meet up often because we are all scattered out over the country. It was a good reminder of how lucky I am to have such a good family. 

I am looking forward to next time.",2,2
592,374,"So my ex girlfriend contacted me on Facebook last month. I haven't talked to her in about 15 years. It really took me by surprise because I never knew what happened to her after we went our separate ways. I did always think of her though. 

So, she wrote me a really casual message saying hey, how are you. We made some small talk for a while. Then she told me she would be coming down to Florida and wanted to see me. I was really surprised by that, but I saw no reason we couldn't get together as friends. So we made plans to have dinner and drinks to catch up. 

I was so nervous because it's been so long. I actually started to get some of those old feelings back. She was my first love after all. So it was Friday night and we met at the bar in Chili's. When I saw her my heart was beating so fast. We hugged and ordered some drinks and food. She seemed nervous too, but we ended up having such a fun conversation. 

We talked about old times, but more so what we have done with our lives. She was really proud of who I am today, because I used to be such a punk. When it was time to leave she kissed me and said she missed me. That kiss felt so good, but we didn't take it any further than that as we are both in relationships.",3,3
593,375,"A little over a month ago, I reached out to a girl that I had met online last December. At that time, we had chatted for a while and then I had gone to visit her in New York City, where she was from, but a few weeks later, the brief beginning to a possible romance ended. I thought about her a lot over the next several months, and finally, about 5 months later, I contacted her again. I didn't know if she would respond, but to my delight, she did. However, emotions and feelings still had to be sorted out and ultimately we took a month or so break from communication again. 

It was then, in June, while about to take a week-long vacation to the beach with my family -- the travel route of which would take my by the town where she lived while going to school -- that we reconnected and planned to meet up on my way back from the beach. We decided to go to a theme park close by, one that I hadn't been to since I was probably in high school. All week I was excited and a bit nervous. Would this simply be two friends hanging out, or would it be something more? 

When I finally met up with her, things were a bit awkward at first; it had been a long time since we had seen each other and I was trying to feel out how to act. However, the next day when we went to the park, things were very fun and the conversation between us flowed naturally and easily. We even flirted and made some physical contact. We spent a long day at the park and rode all sorts of rides, and in the time we spend walking around and waiting in line, we talked a lot about each other and grew closer. 

At the end of the day, we went to her place -- both of us were pretty exhausted. While we were there, we talked intensely about the situation between us and really made a heart-to-heart connection. I told her I had wanted to kiss her all day but wasn't sure if I should. She responded that she had been waiting for me to do so. We sealed the day with a kiss, and since then we've been seeing each other almost every week. 

I think back to that day a lot as the start of something wonderful.",3,3
594,376,"I had been in a serious relationship for about 5 years. I met him in high school and eventually ended up dating. We started a family together and I thought this was it, we would be together forever. I was completely in love with him. 

We had just decided I would quit my job to stay home and take care of our son, daycare was just too expensive for us. I quit my job and the very next day he tells me he doesn't want to be with me. He told me he didn't love me anymore and he didn't think he ever would. My heart broke into a million pieces. You hear that saying often but now I actually understand what it means. 

I was suddenly a single mother, jobless, homeless and heartbroken. I ended up staying with my father and step mother, who helped me more than they probably realized. They were there for me and kept me up until I could get back on my feet again. They helped me heal and get back out there. 

I never thought I would feel okay again, but after some soul searching and healing even me and my ex have become friends again. I realized during this time that even when things seem like they could never possibly get better, they always will. It will not always be easy, and it will not always happen fast.",3,3
595,378,"I have been working at my job for over 3 years now. 5 months ago there was an opening for a full time position doing what I was doing part time. I decided to apply for the position as did several other members from my current team. This was a big event because benefits are great here and so full time spots are very rare and competitive when they do open up. 

I worked on my resume and case for weeks on end to ensure I had the best chance of getting the position. I got into a few spats with coworkers about who should be promoted as well. This caused a lot of tension among us and made actual work tough for nearly a month. 

We had a first wave of interviews that knocked out half of the applicants. This made things even worse as some longer tenured employees were not pushed through to the second round of interviews. I was lucky enough to be pushed through myself. 

After the second round, we had two days where we did not know who had won the position. This was also stressful for us and put more tension on the office and all of us personally, as it was a life changing event for anyone who won the spot due to the salary and our life trajectories. 

After a few days, my manager called me into his office and informed me that I had won the position. This was a surprise to me as I thought other members were favored over me and would get the position. I was ecstatic to win the spot, as my salary more than doubled and I got great benefits. Despite the stresses I was very happy with the situation.",3,3
596,379,"A few months ago, I was given a promotion and a raise at my job. This is a very important milestone for me because I am still relatively young and haven't been at my current employer for very long. However, my bosses felt that it was time to give me more responsibility and more money for the work that I have done for them so far. More importantly, because I am still young, it shows that I am gaining a growing reputation in my field. 

I work in a relatively large area in terms of population, but my field isn't very big. Most people who work in the field know one another and word spreads quickly. In the time I've with my current employer, I've already met many of my counterparts at other organizations. I've also met many of the owners and supervisors of other organizations in the field. 

Getting a promotion and more recognition so quickly will allow me to have more options if I decide to leave my job. Additionally, it made me feel good that I was able to impress my bosses. Many young employees don't get the opportunity that I've gotten so far so it was important that I made a good impression. 

I've found that people appreciate my work ethic and my hard work, which are two things that are important to me. I've come along way since college and it wasn't the easiest road, so to be working in and excelling in my field is an important sign of who I am as a professional. 

I intend to take this on and continue making my bosses pleased with the decision to hire me in the coming months. I also intend to see if it has impressed people outside of my organization for other potential opportunities.",1,1
597,382,"I moved to the US when I was 26 years old with my family. Since then, I missed my mom a lot. We visited each other a couple of times but lately the money was tight. After saving some money, I was able to get my parents to come here and visit us again this year. We had a great time together as a family. 

Somehow, I really wanted to celebrate her birthday this year. I usually just send some money home for her birthday but this time I want to make it special. I invited my sister and her in law to our house. I asked my sister to take her to the mall while I was preparing everything. I bought the food, drinks and a cake. 

She blew the candle and made a wish just like a child. She was smiling and laughing all the time. She admitted that was the first time someone bought a cake for her and we were in tears. I felt so bad that I never really pay attention to her needs. I felt that we need to appreciate her more and make her feel special. Especially after I am a mom, I am more aware about her struggles and her feelings.",3,3
598,383,"In the beginning of April my grandfather died. He had been ill with dementia and physically deteriorating for a while but I still wasn't prepared to lose him. He was mentally declining and most of the time he would just sit in his chair and go in and out of a mental fugue state. 

The last time I saw him was six days before he died. He was already in hospice care and depressed. I showed him a picture of my newborn son and we talked about baseball. It was his favorite sport and he loved to watch the Detroit Tigers. He was very lucid and aware. He talked to me about how much he still missed Verlander since the trade and that he hoped the Tigers would have a good year despite losing so many players. He then told me that my baby looked like my wife. It was a very emotional day. 

His death really taught me to appreciate every moment of every day. I had spent so much of my time rushing through life that I never bothered to consider that it will eventually end. There will be some people who will really miss me after I am gone. 

I inherited money from his estate and invested the bulk of it. One of my most fond, recurring, memories from when I was a child was going to my grandparents lake cottage and spending weekends and vacations there. To honor my grandfather and provide my own children that kind of experience I purchased a cottage this summer, on a lake about an hour and a half drive away. 

On weekends we all go up there and relax. My daughter loves the beach and just sitting out in the shady yard. My little one is scooting around the place pretty good and likes to go sit under an umbrella and play in the sand. Every time I am there I think about my grandfather and wish so very, very much that he could be there to enjoy this with us. At times it feels like he is there. 

I firmly intend to instill all the values that I learned from him over the years. He was a good man, a simple man, and he was always looking for the sun after the rain.",3,3
599,384,"I recently gave birth to my second child. She was born a few days ago. She was induced at 39 weeks gestation. The induction went very well and I was pretty comfortable during the whole process. I got an epidural early on. I felt no pain until it was time to push. Even then, it wasn't that bad. 

I was nervous about pushing her out because I had problems with my first child. The same issue happened with my second so she had to be delivered with a vacuum. I was concerned I had to have a C-section but my doctor did a good job to make sure that didn't happen. 

The most memorable part of the experience is when the nurse held her up for me to see. I was surprised at how big she was since she was supposed to be very small. She handed her to me and she got to lay on my chest. She came out basically perfect with little bruising to her head but she sure cried a lot for the first half hour! 

It was a very tiring but good experience overall, even though I never want to give birth again. She is a good baby.",2,2
600,387,"Today I took my dad to the Game 7 watch party for the Stanley Cup. It was an away game so we couldn't go to the actual game but we had the next best thing in watching it at the stadium with 20 thousand other fans. My dad said he didn't want to go since he couldn't handle the stress of the game but i surprised him with tickets anyways. 

This was a big deal for me since my dad is the reason I am into hockey and he had been watching the Blues his whole life and they have never won it. I knew he would regret it if he just stayed home watching the game alone instead of having the chance to be downtown if we actually won it. 

It was a stressful start of the game but luckily we scored first and never looked back. We looked like a team on a mission and that mission was to bring the Stanley cup to our town for the first time ever. I could see my dad got a little more happy and less stressed with each goal we scored like he was starting to believe we might actually do it. 

I was also freaking out inside because i knew we had been close before but always got let down and anything can happen in sports. Its never over until the final horn sounds so in the back of our minds we kept thinking the worst. 

When they actually did it we went crazy with all the other people at the stadium but also I could see my dad crying a little. It brought me joy to know how happy he was in this moment and i was glad i was here to share it with him. 

This is something we will continue to talk about for years to come and we will always know where we were when it happened. He brought me to a game 7 in the world series when i was young so this was also a way for me to repay the favor but i hope to repay it again sometime in our lifetime with an actual game ticket. 

To be in that stadium though when the whole city felt like they won was a great memory to have and one that I will be forever grateful i shared with my dad.",3,3
601,388,"One of the most memorable things that happened to me recently was when I missed my flight to the airport. I was flying from Vancouver, Canada back to my hometown in New York. I was in Vancouver for a Spring internship that lasted four months. So needless to say, I was carrying a lot of stuff. I had two enormous suitcases and my carry-on backpack. 

Unfortunately, for me, I woke up late on the day of my flight. My flight was scheduled to leave at 6 am. I woke up at four-thirty and raced to the airport. Nonetheless, it was too late. I was stranded. 

I had already spent most of my money on rent and food during the internship. I didn't have a credit card, only a debit card with a purchase limit of $100 and $40 in cash. This was not enough to pay a new flight back to New York. I was sure that I was going to have to spend the night at the airport until I could get a hold of my parents. 

I told my story to a West Jet agent, I'll call Mike. Mike was a godsend. He spoke to his supervisor and pulled some strings to get me on the next flight back to NYC. I only paid $50 for the extremely discounted ticket. I was so happy and grateful. 

That was one of the few times in my life that I've seen someone truly go out of their way to help someone in need.",2,2
602,389,"The house next to me is a rental. I've had some great neighbors there for the past 7 months, but they told me when I met them that that was only going to be a temporary place for them. They were new to the area and just needed a place to live until they could find a home to buy. They spent a long time looking for a place to call their own and eventually found it in a nearby town. Even though I know I'll still see them from time to time, it was hard to see them go. 

After my old neighbors moved out, I wondered who'd move into the house next door. I didn't have to wait long to find out. Almost as soon as my old neighbors moved out, a new neighbor moved in, and I went over and introduced myself to her. She was happy to meet me. It turns out, we have a lot of things in common and even know some of the same people. I was relieved because you never know who might move into a rental. 

Better yet, this woman plans on staying there until she dies (her words, not mine), so there shouldn't be people coming and going there anymore for some time to come. My new neighbor is elderly and needed some help moving things into her new home, so I helped her. Afterwards, I took some brownies over so she could enjoy a little chocolate after dinner. She was so happy about that, she went on and on about it. 

Then, a few days later, she called me over to her place and told me that she had something she wanted to give me. It was something I needed for my kitchen which I hadn't been able to find in the stores. I vaguely remembered mentioning something about it to her, but I was surprised she paid any attention to it and then did something about it. She saw exactly what I was looking for at a yard sale and purchased it for me. I offered to reimburse her for it, but she wouldn't let me give her a penny. She said she was just so thankful to have a good neighbor who was so helpful that she wanted to give it to me as a thank you. 

I was deeply touched. I know we're going to get along great.",2,2
603,390,"I'm thinking a lot about my older sister these past few months. Last October, she lost her husband to a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was only 57 and had been suffering for three and a half years. This came six months after our Dad had passed from complications due to a stroke. 

This summer was particularly challenging for my sister as my Dad's birthday and her anniversary was in July so she was very sad. When I called my sister on her anniversary to let her know I was thinking of her, she told me she had not even heard from our mother and was very hurt by that as our mother, out of everyone, should have known how my sister was feeling that day. 

Whenever I would speak to my sister, she would be upset about something our mother had said to her. For example, in trying to go through paperwork, my mother would say to her, ""at least you have your girls to help, I have no one"". It's hard for me to even think our mother could be so harsh because my sister's husband died so young whereas my dad was in his 80's and had lived a great life. 

This insenstivity extended to our younger sister, who instead of offering her support, chose to bring up an event that happening 8 years ago at our parent's 50th anniversary. It escalated earlier this summer over text messages with some very vile things said to each other and they are no longer speaking to each other. 

In fact, my younger sister tried to get me to take her side when I went for a visit for her son's graduation. Thankfully, my younger sister's husband told her that she should not drag other people into her fight with my older sister. 

It was heartbreaking to her that our mother and younger sister are that insensitive to my older sister and what she is going through. This made me want to make a point of reaching out more regularly to my sister to check in to see how she is doing.",3,3
604,392,"On July 4th, I was at home in the morning doing nothing and feeling kind of sad. I unexpectedly got a call from one of my friends and she invited me out with her and her boyfriend. I was kind of surprised and pleased at the same time. 

We ended up going to the movies to see Spider-Man and it was such a funny movie. After that, we got dinner at a local Mexican restaurant nearby. I ordered tacos and my friends order nachos to share. 

We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things. 

About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky. My friend made a comment that it would be the perfect spot to stay and watch the fireworks. I agreed and we sat down and waited for the show to start. 

After the fireworks show was over, we all went home. I felt so happy that my friend wanted to share that holiday with me and it made my entire day so much better. I was very happy.",2,2
605,393,"Earlier this month I had the opportunity to present at a local conference about women's rights. For many years I have focused my studies on female empowerment as well as women's rights, so it was an honor to be asked to speak. I was exceedingly nervous leading up to the event; I had written my speech as well as made my presentation before but this time it was different. 

The attendees at this conference were a lot of big names in my city as well as community. I spent the weeks leading up to the presentation studying my material and going over my slides; I had it down perfectly. 

When the day finally came, I was so nervous. I paced my hotel room for hours going over the material in my head, I visualized it going perfectly in my head. The ride down the elevator to the ballroom and walking to the room felt like it took hours, but once I finally got to the podium all my emotions went away. I knew my material and I was so excited to share something I was passionate about to some people that I really cared about and were foremost in their field. 

The presentation went off without a hitch and I received a lot of great questions from the audience. A one hour presentation felt like it went by in seconds! After I finished, I was greeted with strong applause and a lot of smiles and cheers. I felt so proud of myself and so excited that it was done. 

I met many of my colleagues afterward and they congratulated me on a well done presentation as well as great material. I was asked to speak next year as the keynote and I could not be more excited. All of my hard work, patience, and excitement paid off. I am already looking forward to next year and cannot wait to share more stories and information with my colleagues.",3,3
606,395,"A few months ago our family members received a devastating call about a family member. They went to a game in Florida, where our cousin had to play. Our cousin had a great game and played very well. At the end of the game, his mother and father were gonna celebrate his game victory, but instead there was a life threatening turn of events that occured. 

They waited and waited and he never came to the room. So soon after they got a call from the coach and during the call they heard frantic screaming in the background-it was their son. The coach said we have called 911, your son is in severe pain. So the EMTs arrived and picked him up. At that time, he began to have seizures. 

Once they arrived to the hospital, they rushed him in the back. We all thought he was not going to make it through the night. When we received the first call, we were already in route to go to check on him. The seizures continued until they had to give him some medicine to stop them. Things seemed to get better, but he stopped responding. 

Over the next day, he was not physically talking and continued having seizures. His body took a bad hit. All the tests were showing nothing was wrong. After a few days, the seizures stopped topping a total of 12 within a few days. He still was not talking, but he was alive! He did not talk for a week. 

Tests finally determined that he had suffered a heat stroke. Finally, an answer to the mysterious chaos. He became a living miracle. He regained his strength in walking then started talking. He still wants to play football, but it has not been recommended by doctors.",3,3
607,396,"Well, I think that I just lost my best friend. They haven't spoken to me in some time and I don't quite understand why. I'm so confused because less than a month ago, we were fine, we weren't fighting or saying anything stupid. We were just existing and being best friends. 

I had a weird feeling just before they stopped talking to me, like something was off. I figured it was nothing and chose to ignore it. But now I'm convinced that it wasn't quite like that. They told me that they had been avoiding people and trying to just live, that they had been tired and busy all of the time. This makes sense, but I don't know when you stop being busy, or when you're too busy for someone you care about. 

I always figure it takes just a minute, even less, to answer someone's texts or to say, ""Hey, I'm sorry, I'm a little busy, I'll let you know what's going on later."" It's bothering me so much. I'm stressing about it almost constantly. I can't get it off my mind. 

I'm really hurt, because I don't know how it goes from being best friends and always talking, to this. I don't know where that friendship goes? Where do you draw the line between always wanting someone around, to completely ignoring them and deleting them from your life?",3,3
608,397,"This happened a while back, I think around 6 months ago. I was travelling with a family friend of mine to Florida where we met this very beautiful girl while we were filling up on gas. She was driving a 1960's Mustang. I think that is what led me to go on and ask her how she got it. We started discussing and how she too was travelling to Florida. I eventually got to the point of asking about her car. 

She told me one of the most surprising stories ever! Supposedly, the car she had was inherited from her father who literally found it stored away at a broken down shelter. It really surprised me because I've heard of such ""barn finds"" but I never really got to witness it. She told me how her father found it in non-working state, and he worked on it for years on and off to get it working and back on it's former shape. 

After getting it back to proper working condition, her father looked around for the owner and never found him/her. However, after her father passed away, which was unfortunate, she did find the owner of the car. The guy said, the he never imagined his lost car to be brought back to life like this and he was actually happy for her and pretty much let her go with it. 

Honestly I was really inspired by it since the car I want to have is also a vintage on like that. We soon exchanged numbers and we drove alongside each other, my family friend also really enjoyed her company. I eventually got to know her more and we started dating!",2,2
609,398,"Few months ago we were driving with my husband for a trip to another town. My husband was driving and I was sitting next to him. We always have amazing time when we are driving somewhere. I can say that I enjoy being in the car together, because of conversations we have and gossiping about family here and there (like every family does). 

My husband was so much into conversation. He really like gossips. I have to admit that he is horrible with attention. They say that men can't do more things in once and I totally agree with this saying. 

While he was so much into conversation and he wanted to change lanes, he did not see the car coming. We were on the highway so our car, as well as the other car were driving so fast. We almost had very bad car crash. 

I was shaking from the fear and stress and I started to cry. My husband felt so bad, he stopped the car when it was possible and hugged and kissed me so much. Later on he said that for a second the idea of losing me came into his mind. I had exactly the same on my mind. 

Since that time we are driving slower and being more responsible. We both realized how fragile are our lives and how much we love each other.",3,3
610,399,"A recent time in my life that was memorable for me was when my father died. When my father died, it hurt me and my family. My father was fairly young when he died at the age of 47. It was a hard time for everyone after he passed away. 

My father died about 6 months ago due to diabetes. He was a diabetic for a long time, but then he had a stroke, and it made his condition even worse. My father was a healthy man a few years back, but he liked to drink alcohol.. mainly beers. After work, he would always drink a few beers to relax. 

After my father had the stroke, he past away a few months after. It really hurt me to see him die fairly young, and it devastated my family. I could not function properly after he died, and it left me depressed. It left me to a point where I started drinking myself, just to let the pain go of him not being here anymore. 

I had to tell myself that drinking was not the answer, and he would want me to move on, and continue to make him proud by being successful in life. It was a very painful time in my life. I got through it with help of friends and family, and now I try my best to make my father proud, by being the best man I can be.",3,3
611,400,"My son started college. We loaded up both of our cars with all of his things and headed to his college which was 3 hours away. This is our first child leaving for college so it is stressful, expensive, and just sad. It was even worse for me as my car's check engine light came on while we were driving him down. I had to say my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot which was less than ideal. We managed to fit all of his stuff except his bike into one car and I drove back home in case something major was wrong with the car. 

My wife finished driving him to school to unload all of his stuff. My oldest daughter went with them to help but we didn't have room in that car for my younger daughter who I drove home. I didn't even get to see his dorm room or campus or anything. 

I miss him a lot as everything just seems different now that he is gone. I text him regularly but it certainly isn't the same as seeing him all of the time. He is coming back to visit on labor day so at least we have that going for us. 

The car had some sort of electrical problem causing it to misfire, $800 later it is fixed. My wife drove his bike down a week later. 

The entire reason we took him to college early was for band camp. He got accepted to the band but decided he didn't want to do it so turned them down. Wish we had just waited 2 more weeks to move him in.",3,3
612,401,"Five months ago, at the age of 63, i retired. This was an extremely important event; something i had looked forward to for quite a long time. After working in social service fields for approximately thirty years i was definitely ""burned out."" I had been a caseworker at the local Department of Social Services for a little over fourteen years. Then i spent approximately the same amount of time as a counselor working at a non profit agency. 

There are some who believe that this field of employment; working with all types of people who need a variety of services, is the number one field for burnout. whether or not this is true, i can honestly say that when i had the chance to retire, i knew it was the right time. The fact is that i had planned on working until i was 65 but i really needed to ""get out."" I had lost a lot of my patience; little things were beginning to annoy me, and worst of all i didn't feel as if i was giving the clients my best efforts. 

I can truly say that i am now the happiest I have ever been. Not only am i retired, but i spend four days a week with my wonderful two year old granddaughter. My wife runs a small day care center here in our house, so Kinsley comes over here four days a week and there is no way i can describe how much I adore her. She is our first grandchild; i had no idea how much i was going to enjoy my time with her. She seems to learn something new almost every day. 

The fact that i am retired means that i am on my own schedule and can spend as much time with Kinsley as i want. Things are so good with my life right now that it's almost too good to be true. 

What made my retirement so emotional was that i knew it was something I really needed emotionally. I knew it was the right time to stop working. Spending so much time now with my granddaughter makes it all even better.",3,3
613,402,"I was at piedmont dragway shooting a race and got two videos of 2 cars crashing. I didn't know it at the time but I was one of the very few that got the best view of both crashes. I was just in the right place at the right time. After the event I quickly uploaded both videos and in a week I got a combined 20k views from them on facebook. This was a major accomplishment for me because my channel is small. This launched my media page from 400 to 530 likes practically in 2 days. 

This was a big confidence boost for me. I wasn't ready to give up but with all the obstacles that I face this year i felt like I was gonna be left behind. Ironically this videos lead to me getting into tracks for free. Something that's helped me financially and makes me want to work harder. 

Its made me more confident to book more races next year. This is because I'm beginning to build a reputation. I've been very fortunate to have something like that happen to me and want to do it again. This is not the ending but only the beginning. And hopefully this doesn't become a one hit wonder.",2,2
614,403,"I decided to go on a bike ride on this trail. It is the longest paved trail in the USA. It is between ninety to one hundred miles long. About twenty five miles into the bike ride, I flipped over my handlebars and crashed. I cannot remember exactly how it happened. Some people that witnessed the crash say that my back tire skid on something and that caused me to crash. 

The only thing I remember is realizing that I'm going over my handlebars in slow motion. Before I hit the ground, my head seemed to turn off. So I don't remember my head hitting the ground, fracturing my teeth, using my hands to try to stop my fall or any other parts of the crash. 

According to the doctor and nurse practitioner, it is perfectly normal to not remember anything before or after the crash. I just felt really lucky that I wore a helmet. I was told that if I did not wear a helmet I would have either been brain dead and in a coma or dead. 

I did split open an area right above my eye and it required stitches, but I did not have facial fractures, skull fracturing or any brain bleeding. Another great thing is that I did not break my wrists or arms in the fall when I tried to brace my fall. 

I am really happy that the couple found me and called the ambulance to come get me. The ambulance took me to the hospital and they helped take care of me by doing CT scan and some other tests. The CT scan showed that everything was fine in my brain. I didn't have any bleeding or swelling. I ended up being released from the hospital on the same day. 

A few days later my right eye was swollen and my lips were swollen from being busted during the fall. I looked terrible but I still decided to go outside and handle my life affairs. People would stare at me. Some people would think that someone had beat me up. I'll never forget some people thinking that I had been caught cheating with someone's girlfriend or wife by another man.",2,2
615,404,"My family and I went on a trip to Texas five months ago. My son was graduating Corpsman School in the Navy and we were headed to the graduation. We decided to drive because it was cheaper than flying and there were three of us. On the way we could stop and see family members I haven't seen in a few years. We packed up snacks and sandwiches for the road trip and were on our way. We were so excited to see our son. He has been away for almost a year and this was the first time we got to see him. 

It took us two days to get there and and the first night we stayed with family. It was so nice to see my mom and sister. We all went out to eat and tried to catch up as much as we could. We called it a night at about eight because we needed to get up at three to get moving on the last stretch. 

The trip itself was fun. We all love road trips and this one we got to see places we have never seen before. We got to Houston, Texas around four in the afternoon. We checked into our hotel and headed down to the restaurant to get dinner. 

The next morning we got up real early. We headed over to the base, checked in and tried to find a parking spot. It took awhile and we were almost late to the ceremony. We then walked over to the auditorium. We were seated and then watched as all the sailors came in and sat down. The ceremony was awesome and afterwards we got to spend the rest of the day with my son. It was so nice to see him again. 

At the end of the day we said goodbye and headed back to our hotel. The next day it was back on the road again. It was such a nice trip even though we were short on time.",2,2
616,405,"I had to decide. Should I look in my wife's briefcase or not? She had left it on the kitchen table when she had to run out for a few minutes after getting back from work late. I wasn't even sure what I would be looking for. Broadly speaking, I was going to look for the truth. Just what was the truth — the reality — of our marriage? 

The situation was that our 17 year marriage was in serious trouble. During the last few years my wife had seemed out of sorts with me. To her, nothing I did was right. Our sex life had also dwindled away to nothing. My attempts to talk were met with lectures about how the only problem was me. I needed to understand that married life with young kids meant intimacy was not on the priory list. Kids as well as her career came first. I also needed to stop being overly sensitive about perceived slights from her when, according to her, there were none. 

I didn't know it at the time but she was totally gaslighting me. The last thing she wanted was an honest heart-to-heart talk. In the last few months the situation had gotten much worse. It turned out she had been having an affair with a good friend of mine for over two years. She swore how that one affair was all there was and that it was now over. 

We were going to start marriage counseling in a week. I had to push her to agree to go but at least she had finally acquiesced.",3,3
617,406,"Over the summer, I helped my mother move into an assisted living facility. She was not happy to go, but at the same time, she knew that she could no longer maintain her own apartment, and needed some help on basic tasks. Moving her out of her home was hard. I was sad as I saw her part with many items that she no longer had room for. I was able to hold onto some items for her, like our family photo albums, which made me feel sentimental about the times when we all lived together and my father was still alive. 

The assisted living space was nice, but it felt impersonal to me, like moving into a hotel room. I worry that the staff won't take good care of her, that she will be lonely or mistreated. She says she has made some friends, but she still sounds lonely. 

I can't visit her as often because she doesn't like to sit in the common room and doesn't want me in her room. I take her out to dinner but feel sad when I drop her off. Seeing her so vulnerable is unusual to me. I have always thought of her as strong. Now it seems I am stronger. 

Having recently dropped a son at college, I can say this was the opposite experience. In dropping him off, I saw him making his way toward manhood, whereas in moving my mom to the home, I see her becoming more childlike again. 

This new way of life is difficult for me, though I expect it is more difficult for her, as she has lost her autonomy in many ways.",3,3
618,407,"I have five children in age from 23 down to 16. The 16 year olds are twins (just for the record). In the middle of those, I have an 18 year old daughter. She has always been fairly quiet and somewhat reserved, but has been a good kid and we rarely have had to worry about her. She decided several years ago that she wanted to graduate from high school with an associates degree. My wife and I both thought this was a great idea and we fully supported her in doing this, but we also advised here that it would be a lot of work. 

When she got to high school, she got right into it. Initially, at least, she needed some help figuring out how to go about knowing what classes to take, etc. She also couldn't start the ""early college"" program until she was a junior (11th grade). She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years. We were very pleased to see what she was doing. 

This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation. The following month, she graduated from high school with honors. I was very proud of her and thought she had done an outstanding job. We thought the future for her looked bright. 

A few weeks after her high school graduation, I discovered a number of messages on her instragram account, which were on a shared cell phone we use as the ""home"" phone. The messages were between her and a relative and were extremely vulgar, crude and inappropriate. My head hurt more than it ever had after reading these messages because my view of my daughter had changed and not for the better. I was disappointed and distressed to have this happen. 

Shortly thereafter, in early June, while I was at work, she told my wife that she was leaving. She packed up some of her things , walked out the door, and left. I have not spoken to her since, although we know where she is. I have been heartbroken about this and have not known what to do about the situation. She's 18 and can make her own choices, but we wished she had not made this choice.",3,3
619,408,"My cat, Archie, likes to play with those hard colored gum balls all the time. I don't know how it started but he's taken to batting them around the hard wood floors of mine and my husband's home. He plays with the gum balls (Archie, not my husband) for a week or two, before I throw them out and replace with a new one. I find it wasteful, but whatever, it's his only vice. 

Both my husband and I find it funny, like we do with everything our animals do. We often bond over our love for them and our shared love of stand up, food, wildlife rehabilitation, coffee and Elvis. We also bond over similar emotional health hurdles that we've dealt with throughout our lives. 

My husband and I have a host of separate issues resulting from bad childhood trauma on both ends. We've done a lot of reflection and are pretty careful to navigate our problems with respect and compassion for each other. That's not to say we haven't had our fair share of problems though. We've dealt with insecurity, snide remarks, jealousy, trust issues etc. 

Recently, we were really going through it when I found out he hid something from me that he found embarrassing. It make me question his honesty and ability to communicate with me. I was so upset and felt like a lot of what we had worked on in our relationship was moot. 

We were both sitting on our bed, my cheeks tear-stained after a long, long talk about the issue. It was pretty silent when we heard a gumball roll across the floor in the adjacent room. My husband and I said, in perfect unison: ""Get that gum ball, Archie."" It was like we'd rehearsed it...This random, bizarre phrase that nobody else has probably ever said. I let out a choked half laugh/half cry and my husband did too. 

It's really strange. Therapy and self-help books and talking out everything has helped our marriage a lot. It's given us tools to work through bad habits taught to us by our parents and we've managed to navigate through a lot of the toxic muck that often destroys relationships. 

But sometimes, I think we need the reminder that our lives are really great even with the hard moments and what we've built with our love and our home and our effort and our animals, is something that I'd never trade in a million years. 

Thank you, Archie. You deserve all the gumballs. Me and CatDad love you a lot.",3,3
620,409,"On May 27, my wife gave birth to our first child, a beautiful baby daughter that we instantly loved more than anything in the world. The entire experience was more emotionally moving than I anticipated. It started with a very long labor for my wife who initially tried to go through labor without relief from drugs, and during this time she needed me more than ever. I had to be strong, physically and emotionally, to help her cope. Eventually she took the epidural and the labor became more of a waiting game. 

But giving birth is every bit as complicated as it sounds, and we got to the point that it just wasn't progressing even with drugs given to speed up my wife's contractions. As a result, she had to have a C section, a devastating result for her and I once again had to be stronger than I actually am and do my part to calm her down. 

Once that beautiful baby was born, nothing else mattered. She looked healthy and seemed to instantly bond to us. I was scared for my wife who just went through a pretty serious surgery and at the same time wanted to give my full self to the little helpless human being. 

Having family at the hospital was really a blessing, all so anxious to help and to see our little creation. It also helped that the doctors and nurses were every bit as smart and helpful as we could have asked for. The details of that day are permanently engraved in my mind. 

The following days, which involved almost no sleep and horrible hospital food, are days that I wouldn't give up for anything. Having the nurses there for support and questions was something we never wanted to give up.",3,3
621,410,"I didn't really plan on going to graduation. I never planned to go to graduation. I said I was getting out and never ever looking back. It costs money just to travel there and have the outfit. And I don't like it there nor do I like the people. I look back on my time there as struggle and pain. 

But I looked at Facebook the morning of graduation and there was a small pain. Seeing two of my almost friends in their caps and gowns, with their families made me slightly sad for what I didn't have. Finishing didn't feel like a celebration and maybe had I gone I could have made it be one. They had been through struggles similar to mine and they were there, in the gowns, celebrating. 

I could have gone and seen them off, and gave that university and city where I spent so many years of my life a proper goodbye. So I sat there, looking at Facebook, thinking about how the last time I left I didn't know it was going to be the last time. 

I realized that part of why I hadn't wanted to go was because most of my friends had graduated years before and I wasn't really close to anyone else. Dragging them back for my graduation wasn't something I felt comfortable doing. 

And I realized that somewhere deep inside I had seen myself being dragged into graduation, begrudgingly going. But people had listened when I said no. 

Facebook, ignoring privacy as usual, alerted one of my almost friends I was online. She sent me message asking where I was and if we could meet to take photos together. When I told her I was not there she expressed disappointment. She wrote me a message about how sad it was to not see me as she saw me as directly responsible for her even making it to graduation. 

At the same time, other almost friends who had graduated previously were online congratulating the two. Upon seeing I was online, they wrote to me as well. One expressed congratulations to me and spoke of how she was glad I was finally free. The other spoke of how we would celebrate in the future, as I had celebrated her graduation with her and she could not have gotten through without me. 

And I told myself that I didn't need to be at that graduation because I had what I needed from it--the people who understood how much it took and the feeling of being free of it.",3,3
622,411,"My favorite event that has happened to me in a long time happened this year as I was able to take my daughter to Six Flags for her fifteenth birthday. She had wanted to go for over a year because she enjoys the experience of being able to ride roller coasters all day. She enjoys the rush of the speed you feel, the excitement of the loops and the thrill of dropping at high speeds. 

So this year, on her birthday, we were finally able to take her. She said it was the best time she's ever had, because she got to go to her favorite amusement park and got to experience it with her family and friends on the same day. We rode many rides from sunup until sunset enjoying fun rides, crazy rides, and scary rides. 

At first she was a little timid because it has been almost two years since she last went on a roller coaster, but we made it work and she overcame the fear and persevered to be able to enjoy her day. One ride in particular that she says was definitely her most memorable time because of the sheer terror it puts into you, the height it goes to, and the countless amount of loops was on Superman The Ride. I liked this one also as it suspends you in a flying position throughout the ride. 

We enjoyed awesome snacks throughout the day and really bonded over this experience. She got to hang out with her two best friends and it was good for them to bond because with social activities and school it seems as if they never get the time to hang out and socialize with each other anymore. 

We went on a couple of water rides also, which they both liked and hated because it cooled us off but also because they had to walk around in wet clothing. We also rode the Batman just before dark and it was really enjoyable riding it as the sun was going down. 

All in all a great experience and a very Happy Birthday for my daughter.",3,3
623,412,"About four months ago, I took my son to his first swimming lesson. My son was about six months old at the time, so this was really his first introduction to pools or any sort of water outside of the bath. He was very receptive to the whole experience. He didn't cry, and was more interested in observing the other kids in the pool. I was surprised at how observant he was. The fact that he was simply taking in the whole experience was wonderful. 

It was suggested that I briefly put his face in the water, and to my surprise, he seemed to enjoy it! This was a very special experience for me because I remember going to pools and swimming in creeks and lakes when I was a kid. I'm glad that he was okay being almost entirely submerged in the water. 

This was one event that I was really looking forward to before he was born. Since he was born in December, I was worried that he might not be old enough to do swim lessons this past summer. But I'm very glad that we didn't have to wait until next year. 

I felt like he really relied on me in that pool. Up until that time, my wife was always there to help me with parenting if I run into trouble. This was my first real time being the primary parent. 

All in all, it was a very positive experience and I'm glad I got to be the one to introduce him to the swimming pool.",2,2
624,413,"""I attended college an hour and a half from home, and a few times during the semester my dad would pick me up on Fridays so I could come home and visit for the weekend. We were on the interstate driving home, when my dad starts to tell me a story about a time when he was in the Army. I forget the precise details, but it was basically about how he and some buddies went out on the town one evening and had a few drinks.

The tale becomes a bit more serious and personal all of the sudden like he's pouring his heart out to me. My dad then says that he and his friends ran into another group of guys and got into an argument. The fight supposedly turned physical, with my dad throwing some punches at one of these guys. Then my dad, in the most serious tone possible, tells me that he grabbed the guy and pushed him off a cliff. The guy died and my dad and his friends managed to cover up the whole sordid tale from the police — this was the first time he'd ever admitted it to another living soul outside of that night. 

At this point, I'm horrified. Is my dad just confessing a murder to me? Was this mild-mannered man radically different when he was a 20-year-old kid? Do I tell my mom? Do I tell the police? Do I ask him to stop the car? 

Finally something in the story actually sunk in the part about 'pushing him off a cliff.' My dad was stationed in Louisiana when he was in the military and while I'd never been there, I was pretty sure there weren't that many cliffs. I finally said, ''Wait a minute, a cliff?' I'd been avoiding even looking at him since he made his 'confession,' but now that I looked over, he was about ready to explode. 

No longer able to hold it, he started laughing hysterically and kept saying, 'I can't believe you fell for it! You thought I killed a guy! April Fool's.",3,3
625,414,"I was coming out of the grocery store and saw something black wiggling in the bushes on the edge of the curb in parking lot. I thought it as a duck at first, so I didn't pay much attention, except that maybe I would move it after unloading my groceries so that it didn't get run over by someone else parking at the store. 

I put all my stuff in the back of my trunk and got in my car. All of sudden, I remembered about the baby duck, turned the car off, and got out to go move it to a spot farther away in the parking lot, closer to the canal on the west side of the grocery store. 

I was shocked it see it was not a duck, but rather, a baby kitten covered in ants! I grabbed a Gatorade bottle that I had just bought and in a panic dumped it on top of the kitten to wash off some of the ants. The kitten didn't have his eyes open and was crying loudly at this point. 

A person in the parking lot saw what was going on and ran over with some paper towels that were in her car. Neither of us could find a mom cat or any other kittens. I held the baby close and kept picking off ants. They weren't biting me, so at least I knew they weren't fire ants, but there were thousands of them crawling over my arms and stomach, as well as on the baby kitten. 

I decided the only thing I could do was wrap the kitten in an extra shirt in my car, put it on my lap and bring it home. I have bottle feeding experience and knew I needed to feed him right away. Shelters will euthanize a kitten that cannot feed itself. Asking for help from a rescue group in my area is pointless. I knew no one else would help this kitten, so I did the right thing and brought him to my house. 

I was afraid to bathe him at such a young age, but I had to get the rest of the ants and Gatorade off of him if he was going to have a chance at survival. I stayed up all night feeding him goat's milk from a syringe every two hours. I kept him warm by placing a sock filled with uncooked rice that I heated in the microwave every 30 minutes or so. 

It was a long night, but he survived! I was so happy!",3,3
626,416,"I was driving home from the attorney's office with fresh keys in my pocket after I just signed the papers to close on my new home. The weather was beautiful and I was on cloud nine as I drove down the interstate to celebrate with my wife and kids before soccer practice. I decided to take an express lane to get home faster and was exiting back on to the normal roadway when everything seemed fine. I checked my mirrors and looked back to my right, as I was merging from the left, and saw plenty of space to merge. 

As I was almost completely merged a felt a soft (extremely soft) bump and then a second or so passed and I heard the blast of my horn. It was such slight impact that it took me a moment to realize that I actually was just in an accident. I looked back in mirror and waved to the driver that I was going to get over to the right hand shoulder and pull over. 

As I eventually pulled over the driver of the car got out and started yelling and then the passenger of the car got out and was even more mad. I got out to assess my car and theirs and I see that they are already calling the police. I thought to myself that this was no big deal as my car barely had a scratch on it and theirs only had minor damage. 

As we waited for the police I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back, but because I was the one merging I was going to be at fault. I thought more and more about it and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room. 

As things progressed, I was ticketed and I talked to the other driver and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost. She said that they were alright and were okay and then they left. 

Later on, I found out that they were trying to get a large settlement from my insurance company and hired a lawyer and were claiming injury. It hit me at that point, that I think they were trying to pull an insurance scam. They knew that I would be at fault for merging and they could get money out of the situation. 

Now when I think of that day, I can only think of the accident and how I was taken advantage of and I don't really feel happy about closing on my new house.",3,3
627,417,"Oh how can I even describe the way I feel right now. I am broken. So many questions, no answers. Is it my fault? Why did this happen? All these didn't questions and emotions and I can't decipher them. How did I become the wife of an adulterer. I never thought it would happen to me. I never thought he was the kind of man to do this. I guess we all think this way though until it happens to us. 

The thing that hurts the most though is not just the fact that he has committed adultery but the length of time that its been going on. I guess looking back I should have known but I never questioned his late nights. I never questioned those weekends away. I trusted him wholeheartedly. I think now I just feel so foolish. 

Did he ever laugh at me knowing what he was doing behind my back. That thought hurts so much too. I am trying to come to terms with all this. He has asked for forgiveness but given the length of time he has been doing this I feel like its unforgivable. It if had been a bad lapse of judgment a one time thing maybe two, I could possibly forgive that but 2 years. Come on I don't think I can.",3,3
628,418,"The only memorable event that occurred in the last six months was my first day volunteering at the local Humane Society. I have quite a bit of free time since I am disabled so I thought I'd put some of it to good use. I really enjoy being around animals and they needed volunteers at the Humane Society so I thought it was a perfect fit. I had never done this before, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into but I didn't know that that particular Humane Society treats animals very well and is a no-kill shelter. 

So I went down there and there were five or six other volunteers there and we had to go through a brief training class about how to handle dogs. After that was over some of us stuck around and took a tour of the whole place and checked out some of the animals that were there. Not only did they have dogs but they had lot of cats and kittens as well as other small pets like rabbits, guinea pigs, and even a rat. 

Since I was already down there, I thought I would go ahead and take a dog out for a spin. I found a really cute pitbull by the name of Dolly. Most people think that pitbulls are mean but Dolly was anything but. She was one of the friendliest dogs I ever met. If I was able to have a dog at my apartment, I would have adopted her for sure. 

We went on a walk in the adjacent park and stopped a couple of times to look at flocks of birds or people having a picnic or we just sat by the pond. Every time we sat down Dolly would start jumping up and licking my face all over. It took a little bit to stop but eventually, she did. She was very animated and it looked like she was even smiling during this whole time. 

I've taken plenty of other dogs out for walks but so far, Dolly has been my favorite for sure. She wasn't at the shelter very long since everybody enjoyed her company. She got adopted pretty quickly. I was sad to see her go but there were plenty of other dogs that I could take for walks and play with in the shelter's backyard.",2,2
629,42,"When you have something called a learning disability, even that language is not the right language. Everything that transcends from it is like, anything I get is a mistake, every accomplishment that I achieve, I didn't achieve them because I have this disability thing. 

As someone with a learning disability, I wanted to be done with that so when I got into college, I actually thought somehow wrapped into that acceptance, was a cure. I'm good, I never need to talk about that again, it's not who I am. 

And when I got to Brown, thankfully, I quickly forgot that idea. I realized I didn't want to be alone, that's a very lonely way to feel. I started taking education classes and I learned that one in five people learn and think like I do. Where are they? Like, I don't see them. 

I realized the only way I can find them is that I had to start leading with my story. There are two possibilities in the future for our people. One is that we don't tell our story, and then we live in this place of shame and we're misunderstood and much of our potential is lost. 

The second possibility is the one I'm really excited about. It's that idea that by sharing our stories and associating our other gifts and talents with that part of how our brains work, we could unlock something that's amazing for all of us.",3,3
630,420,"At the age of 18 I had an abortion. The reason for the abortion was that I was going through an illness at the time and I would have needed some assistance, but was led to believe that no one would help me. The night before the procedure I came home and told my mom what was going on. I was crying, begging her to help me and I remember specifically stating that this was not something that I wanted to do and that I hated myself for doing so. 

My mom told me that she was going to tell my father and, seeing as how he did not speak to me during that time, I was under the assumption that he knew and that was the reason that he chose not to speak to me. 

About 4 months ago, my sister disclosed that my mom did not tell my dad that I was pregnant as the time and instead phrased it as a question, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant. When he was asked this question my father stated that they would have no choice but to help me out. 

This was never disclosed to me so I went ahead with the abortion, thinking that I had no one on my side. To make matters even worse, my mom did not disclose my pregnancy to my father until 5 years after the fact. 

I am now left carrying tremendous guilt and hatred for myself because of what I had done, and everything could have been avoided. This revelation has opened up a new wound and I now feel as though I am dealing with this all over again. 

I do not know what to say to my mom, let alone how to approach the topic altogether. I now feel like a failure even more and I did not stand up for something that I loved dearly. I want to talk to my mom about this but our family is in such discord now that I do not want to add any fuel to the fire.",3,3
631,421,"I went to a holiday celebration with a backdoor cookout. It was memorable in the sense that it was the first planned outing with my children, who are still toddlers. It's been difficult as a homemaker with my toddlers, especially during the first couple of years. I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement. 

The part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child. 

Anyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland. 

My children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food. They got to play around with other children that were also there, and they got to see what an actual party with adults seems like. I personally enjoyed it, and wish for more events like that in the future.",3,3
632,422,"Last month I was part of an amazing charity event that blew my mind and made me feel like I was making a difference. I was told about this event about 3 months ago and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community. 

I did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage and many genres were learned and appreciated. We all were amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success. 

At the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people. 

In the end it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have. It is very important to realize these things in life to really appreciate the life you have been given, and what you can do to make it even better for others. 

If I was given the opportunity to take part in another event like this, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm sure the rest of my colleagues would agree as well.",3,3
633,423,"I was grocery shopping a few weeks ago. I had purchased my items and was leaving the store. I noticed an older woman with a cart of groceries. She was walking home and was trying to figure out a way to carry all of her bags. I live across the street from the grocery store so I told myself i should offer some assistance to her. 

I approached her and offered my help. I told her i would drop my things off at home and come back to help her carry some things. She lived nearby as well. So i did exactly that. I dropped my things off at home, and came back to the store to help her carry her bags to her home. 

She was very appreciative of my help. She wanted to give me a cake she had made and i declined. Instead we talked for a few minutes, exchanged names and phone numbers and laughed about the oddities of life. We had a good time together. 

I learned that she lived alone at home so grocery shopping or shopping of any kind is a challenge. I told her we could go for coffee sometime as a thank you. I felt good about helping her. I think it's important to help others when we are able and i was able to help her. 

I wanted to help her. She's a lovely woman and now we are friends. She knows she can count on me to help if she needs it. I visit with her once a week. We have coffee at her home, out on her patio, or in a coffee shop and just talk. 

I have helped her plant flowers and other items. She started a garden this summer and I help her with that as well.",2,2
634,424,"It was the finals of my competitive match with my online buddies. We had practiced a lot online and in lan tournaments to prepare for the finale. Sometimes we would have time out members when some of us get tired and unfocused. I loved the memory because it was my 2nd competitive scene match and it was my other friend's very first match! We all were looking forward to this moment and what way to make it even better than to figure out it was for real money! Someone had hosted our match and put up $500 for the winners, split evenly of course. You can say there was more pressure but for sure it was nice to see our video game endeavors were finally paying off! 

My pro buddy didn't like how my other friend was brand new. He barely had any experience and he said he was going to cost us the match. I asked my pro buddy to give him a chance and to represent us! He said it was all up to me because I was the one who created the hosting. 

Fast forward game day, we had practiced for a while and were ready to play. Game starts and we are up a heavy lead (3 vs 6). We start choking and we lose the lead big time (6 vs 12). We start grinding and it of course becomes overtime for both the teams (15 vs 15). It ultimately goes to 1 vs 1 with my new friend being the last alive. He magically clutches it and we win the round and the prizepool of $500!",2,2
635,425,"Recently I was looking to purchase a home. While doing so I listed my house for sale by owner. While a house I wanted to purchase did not work out my home still was for sale online and someone decided to see it. 

A few days later a lady came over to look at the house with her realtor. She spent about an hour there checking it out. About an hour after leaving her realtor called and they put a cash offer on my house that I could not refuse. 

Because she was a cash buyer the sale of the house was scheduled within 3 weeks of signing the agreement. I went from casually looking for a house to 3 weeks out from the sale. I had to quickly find a rental while I look for my new house. It took me almost 10 days to find a place that I wanted to sign a lease for but I did end up finding one. 

Between getting the keys and signing the papers I had a total of 6 days to move my entire home. The home inspection went well then it was down to the closing. The closing went smoothly and I walked out no longer being a home owner. 

Definitely a really random and stressful situation that worked great in my favor. All in all it was a great success.",2,2
636,426,"Roughly three months ago, I felt it was time to discontinue a seven year friendship. My friend Daniel and I met when I was 18, and we had a lot in common. Over the span of 7 years a lot of intimate and fun memories were made together. We both attended college, worked, and spent many hours over the weekends hanging out. 

As we both grew older over the span of our friendship, we started to drift apart. Daniel was accepted for a job across the states, and I was in the midst of nursing school. We both were finding it difficult to maintain a friendship, and see each other between our busy schedules. 

Both of us succumbed to our work and school, and had minimal time outside to make plans to see one another. Daniel was hoping that eventually he would be returning here to the south after he completed his job training, but his approval for transfer was never accepted. 

Three months ago my life changed. I grew tired of the distance, as did Daniel. The lack of communication, and vastly different work schedules began tearing our friendship apart. 

Three months ago, Daniel and I made time finally to sit down in person over lunch and discuss our friendship. The discussion did not go well, and we both felt exhausted trying to maintain a long distance friendship any further. I wanted so badly to come up with a reason to continue the friendship, but I was tired of putting energy into a practically non-existent friendship anymore. 

Daniel and I agreed over our lunch that day to walk separate ways. The lunch ended with me in tears, knowing my best friend wouldn't be my best friend anymore. 

Truth is, I still love him and wish him well, but I know it is time to move forward in my life.",3,3
637,427,"Today completes the my move to a new apartment. It's been a long emotional struggle over the last couple months and the last week for sure. It has come to fruition and my girlfriend is not happy about it. I know it's the right thing to do. I had to protect the kids, I just didn't trust the living situation. 

But, it has come at a cost with girlfriend and me. She is very emotional about it, lot's of outbursts, getting mad at me. She has been trying to tear down the kids a bit and really doesn't like my son. But, deep down I know it was right, the kids are happy. 

And I'm excited to get our lives back on track. I'm not sure what will happen with girlfriend and me, but we are trying to work it out. girlfriend is coming around a little bit and I think deep down, she knows this needed to happen. I think she will become even more comfortable with the situation. I feel bad for her, she has so much to process. With her first it's always a struggle and I think her last is just running roughshod over her. 

The actual move was excruciating! I'm tired, my knees and back hurt and I'm exhausted. It was a week of stairs, boxes, trucks and pain. I hate moving.",3,3
638,428,"When I was working for the MLB team in the spring, I was working for a company event at the stadium. There were barely any workers there, but I was with some past professional players. One of them, my boss, went to introduce me to a guy named Al. I didn't think anything of this man. When I went to shake his hand, it hurt. He was massive and extremely strong. I thought, ""is this Al the legend?"" No, there's no way it could be. 

As the event went on, I didn't think anything of the occurrence. Al was throwing batting practice to some of the employees. He was also keeping them all entertained by talking on the stadium microphone. 

At the end of the event, my boss told everyone to thank ""Al the legend"" for coming to the event! I was shocked that I didn't realize it was him. I am still mad to this day that I didn't take the time to ask him any questions. I am still on the look out for him at any events to this day. Who knows, maybe I will run into him again and I can learn something valuable from a pro!",2,2
639,429,"I met with my supervisor and Human Resources in the afternoon to go over my options after the performance improvement plan. They suggested either accepting a voluntary demotion out of the administrative and leadership roles that I had been involved in for over 12 years, or proceed to a pre-disciplinary hearing on the situation. 

That night, I had to face some of my avoidant behaviors. I had been hiding the severity of the situation not just from myself, but also my partner, and had to go home and break down about the entire thing. I sat on the floor and freaking melted down in shame and sorrow about the entire situation. 

When I explained as much as I could about what had been going on, and that on a daily basis, I 'thought I had it. I thought it was under control. I was fixing it. And I didn't want to bother"" her. Her response was immediate. She told me in no uncertain terms that while I was sorry because I didn't want to worry her about it, I SHOULD have been sorry about thinking I had to go through it by myself. That lifted a huge weight. 

Six weeks later, I'm still reckoning with the effect of that conversation on me emotionally. I'm able to have more conversations with her about it. We're stronger than we were before.",3,3
640,430,"We went gem mining last weekend. It was such a fun experience! We definitely paid for it, but overall, it was pretty cheap. Less than ten dollars a head. The only bummer is that it was a panning experience, not a true mining experience. We didn't do any digging. We just played in the mud and slurry (that's water filled with mud and rock particles, specific to mining and sundry.) 

I wound up pegging myself as the ""rock lady."" Everyone was asking my opinion about rocks! Not to toot my own horn, but I correctly identified seven types of precious and semi-precious stones. I ended up bringing home three emeralds, a sapphire, and a ruby. One of the kids found a massive geode. Each of the kids found at least three precious stones. It was so exciting! They were all just as thrilled as I was. I swear, I came off as more excited than they did. But then, I really well and truly love rocks. 

The biggest surprise about the whole experience was how many gems we found. I always worry that the kind of ""tourist-y"" attractions are scams, but sure enough, we struck gold! (Figuratively speaking.) I haven't had that much fun in years. I loved every minute of it, and have extracted promises to do the experience again in the future. My mom actually asked to come next time.",2,2
641,432,"About a year and a half ago, i gave birth to my last son. I have decided to not have any more children since then. 

However, that day was a day that truly changed my life forever. I remember that the night before i had gone to the hospital for having contractions. They told me i was in active labor and that they were going to admit me. Then, about an hour later, the contractions had slowed, so they decided to let me go home for the night. 

I thought that was ridiculous, but i left. While i was at home, i was not able to sleep or even stand comfortably. The next morning, I was still awake from the night before, crying due to the contractions. I was rushed to the hospital when i absolutely couldn't bear the pain anymore. 

Once i was there, my son was born no more than an hour and a half later. It was the first birth where i had my family with me. My other two sons were born out of state. It was very memorable and exciting to have all the love and support in the room. 

A day i will never ever forget.",3,3
642,433,"This happened about 3 months ago. It was during the summer, and all of our bags were packed. My friends and I were ready to go to our trip to Acadia National Park. We were extremely excited for this because we planned this all year long, and it was finally time to embark on our journey together. It was about a 5 hour drive, and it took a long time, but during this drive, it was extremely eventful. 

In fact, what happened that day could have been one of the scariest things that happened to us. While listening to some music, my friend was driving the car and singing along, and stopped paying full attention to the road. Suddenly, I could feel him drifting left to right and not have full control of the car. This scared me instantly, and I shut down the music being in the passenger seat, and told him to focus on the road. 

But there was a cop behind us looking at what we were doing, and he pulled us to the side just to ask to make sure if we were drunk or not. Just experiencing that part really scared us because we knew we all weren't drunk, but the feeling of being pulled aside is a scary moment. 

We continued with our journey, and the entire trip was great. However, just that moment was the one thing that resided within our minds throughout the entire trip. Going through this experience, I learned to always keep our eyes on the road. I know it is a cliche story, but it is what actually happened, and it affected me in a very big way.",3,3
643,434,"I needed to get a job to pay rent for having to move back home for a little while. I got an interview before but I wasn't qualified to work there even though they offered me the job. But at last the store near me got a new manager! I applied there online and called in the store and they were actually interested in me. I had an interview coming up and was so nervous. As far as I knew they didn't pay much but it was so close I was willing to try. 

I got there and interviewed briefly and turns out I'm just what they needed. I asked how much the pay was and it was more than expected! I couldn't believe how lucky I got. I immediately was on the internet planning my future purchases with the extra money I would get. I realized I had to save up as well for a new car. 

But I was so excited to have my own money, but nervous as well. I was nervous to feel ill and still have to go to work. But I'm hoping as long as I keep washing my hands I will be okay. In the end it's a really good opportunity.",2,2
644,435,"Five months ago, one of my favorite bands The Mountain Goats came to town. They played a double show (two shows in two nights.) It was at my favorite venue, Mr. Smalls. My best friend came home from Virginia and saw both of the shows with me. 

One evening we got balcony seats, and the other we were on the floor. It was a wonderful time. Each set list seemed perfectly curated and the second night they played for an extra hour and a half. We had some beers and sang along to almost every song, occasionally glancing at each other to say ""this is awesome."" We met some people from Canada that were very nice. They invited us to a scavenger hunt the next day, but we were too tired from the show to attend. 

Each night ended in more drinks and sitting on my deck at my apartment. It is rare to see my friend as we live in different states, so we usually stay up late when we do hang out. I still think back on those shows as two of the best I've ever seen. I love the Mountain Goats. I also love Mr. Smalls. 

But mostly, I love my best friend and the time that we share.",2,2
645,437,"It was only a short time ago that I got evicted from my apartment. There were several reasons why I got evicted. The first and most direct reason I would say is that my roommate, Cole, moved out unexpectedly. He truly just got bored with living there and made way too much money illegally and not nearly enough money legally. It definitely took a toll on the household. He wasn't pulling his weight and he truly hated that I wanted him to get a real job. So he moved out and that was that. 

Unfortunately, he left less than a week before rent was due and so I was stuck paying for all the rent plus my other bills. I tried making a payment plan with the front office that ended up not working. When I was served with an eviction notice, I really went into denial and thought I could save the apartment rather than take immediate action and go out looking for a new place to live. 

So when it came time for court, I was told I had a week to vacate. I couldn't afford or find a new place in time and I was moving my things out of the apartment at the very last second. The problem was that I felt responsible for my safety, my fiance's safety, and the safety of my two cats. Yet I had nowhere to go. We had to take all of our belongings to a storage unit and stay in our car. 

We drove a PT Cruiser at the time and luckily it was pretty roomy after taking out the back seats and building a little bed area in the back seat. We made a litter box for the cats that we could put a lid on when not in use. It was hard because I felt like such a failure that couldn't even take care of my family. 

This went on for well over a month of having to find places to park at night and sleep, find food, brushing my teeth and washing my hair in public bathrooms, and hoping that I can find places to shower or do my laundry. The stress got to me and I wasn't sure I could even keep going. 

Now I'm living with my in laws and slowly trying to rebuild my life. The only real downside is their aversion to the fact that I'm a woman dating their daughter.",3,3
646,439,"I found out that my wife is pregnant with our first child! When I first found out I was overcome with emotions. At first I was so happy and excited because we had been trying for so long to get pregnant. Then I was overcome with sadness. You see my dad passed away a couple years ago. In my eulogy I spoke how the day that I find out I would be a father would be one of the toughest days for me. That would be because I wouldn't be able to call him and see his excitement. I wouldn't be able to call him for advice. 

My wife is now about 6 months pregnant. Still to this day I have highs and lows because of these two things. Highs because I am so excited to be a dad. Lows because I don't have my dad here to help me. 

We found out we are having a girl! I always thought I wanted a boy first, but when I found out we were having a girl I was so ecstatic. I immediately went into papa bear mode. I began looking into how to be the best dad to a girl. What I needed to know about having a girl. I know that she is going to be the most important thing in my life. 

So this sums up not only my most recent important life experience, but probably the most important one ever!",3,3
647,44,"I recently reconnected with a former love of mine. We had a falling out a very long time ago, and recently ran into each other at the neighborhood Raley's. She just moved back into the city a few months ago. It was very surprising to me that I ran into her. 

She has really beautiful blue eyes, but my favorite part about her is her personality. I'm usually not too great with jokes, but she tends to laugh at most of my dumb ones. We have both changed very much, but it was for the better. 

Now that we have reconnected I'm feeling better then ever. We went out to the movies last week, and got some dinner after. The resturaunt we went to was right down the street at Tahoe Joe's. I got whiskey peppercorn chicken, and she got a fancy salad of some kind. 

We went back to my place and started watching amazon's new show the boys. We really enjoyed it (or at least I think she did). It was very memorable, and I hope to have more memories like this in the future. 

So far, it's going great, and I hope it can only get better!",2,2
648,440,"Less than a month ago, I moved into my first apartment. I had mostly lived with my parents my entire life, except for a short time in college. My boyfriend and I had been preparing to move for a few months, and waited for the call each month from the landlord who would tell us when an apartment became available. Finally, that call came in August that we could move into an open apartment in September. 

Each day leading up to the move, I'd either think about what I needed to pack or pack a few things in boxes. There wasn't much of an urgency until the day before. Things didn't seem real until moving day. 

I woke up at 8 a.m. so I could meet the landlord at 9:30 a.m. It was extremely nerve-racking since the process was new to me. I arrived before my boyfriend and waited on the lobby couch. I spent the next ten minutes texting my friends and family. My boyfriend finally entered the room and I was relieved. We began signing papers and getting all of that sorted out. We both were eager to finish that task so we could start the apartment walkthrough. 

My first time walking into the apartment was surreal. I couldn't believe that I would be living with my boyfriend of two years and away from my parents. I looked around at the large space and still couldn’t fathom that that was my new home. I waited for it to sink in. The apartment had that ""new"" apartment smell of cleaning materials. It was so empty at first, even with all the boxes and furniture. 

I'm still getting settled in. The only thing missing is my dog, who is still living with my family and I miss her dearly. I visit her a few times a week. We'll have her here with us as soon as we pay the very expensive pet deposit, and then I think things will feel more complete.",2,2
649,441,"A couple of months ago, I started going on wilderness adventures with my family. It was amazing to go, just my girlfriend and I, but it was even cooler when we were able to take the kids. My girlfriend and I found this amazing river with beautiful plants and unique rocks along the shore. The water was very clear and calm and we wanted to take the kids kayaking and for a picnic. 

When we arrived, we had the kids assist in helping set up the inflatable kayaks and then we broke off into two teams to head down the river. My girlfriend and our daughter were in one kayak and I was in the other, with our son. We had a lot of fun racing down the river, checking out the landscape and watching fish jump out of the water. 

We got to shore at a great picnic area and spent the afternoon eating lunch and fishing. Sadly, we did not catch any fish, but it was fun trying. We also found and explored a nearby cave. 

The kayaking trip back to the car was a bit tougher, as my arms were tired and our son was just relaxing in the back of the kayak. My arms started to get pretty sore, but we managed. Once back, I carried the kayaks and everything back to the car, so that we could load up and head home. 

During the drive home, my girlfriend and I discussed brights and why they are needed. Sure enough, we ended up having to stop, due to deer being in the road! We were able to navigate down the mountain safely and then got home, showered, and went to bed.",2,2
650,442,"My girlfriend and I moved recently. We had been dealing with financial difficulties in our previous house. We were always pretty poor; I had a low paying job and she was unemployed, but it wasn't a problem before. The biggest issue was that we always had roommates before, but then they moved out. We could have potentially gotten replacements, but the house was so old and run down that nobody seemed very interested. The landlord wasn't very responsive and to make things worse, some squatters had been nextdoor for several months already. 

At a certain point, I no longer had enough money for rent payments. It was a very stressful time in both of our lives. Through some stroke of luck, one of the members of my girlfriend's church was looking for new roommates; someone that was friendly and we could trust. Thankfully, they trusted us as well, since we still didn't have the income to pay rent, but were looking for work. 

We started packing and got ready to leave that old house behind. I still hurt when I think about that old place; we had a big back yard with a beautiful garden and it was fairly peaceful until the squatters were there, but those times are lost to the past now. It took nearly a month to get everything out of there; we had made our lives there together for about 3 years and I had lived there for 6 years before; most of my adult life. Thankfully we were able to get help moving boxes. 

I don't know how we managed to get everything stored away here, but somehow my girlfriend found a way. She can do anything when she puts her mind to it. We've been here for 3 months now and it's starting to feel like home, but there's still things to get used to. We live with 2 other people and have to share a bathroom, which is pretty annoying, but I guess it's okay. 

It almost feels like I'm going through a haze, still, but we keep on going. My girlfriend has a job now and I'm bringing in small amounts, still. Sometimes it feels like we're struggling to make ends meet, but I guess that's life.",2,2
651,443,"It was late summer and I was still in the local baseball recreational league for adults. The team was late for the game as our bus was stuck in the busy Long Beach traffic of the early summer. The weather was light and gray and it was the kind of day where you wake up sleepy no matter the amount of hours that you slept the night before. 

The team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were a subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. 

We had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. 

Once the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game. I was tired of failing at all I tried and I wanted something new for a change. 

At the bottom of the ninth we were down 3-2 as the relief pitcher had let in 3 runs at the top of the inning. We managed to battle back and win it off a two run blast by my childhood friend Jim. It was what we used to dream of as kids. Winning anything together. It didn't happen in the pros but it felt like it did. We never made it to the majors, so this is the best memory I have of the game of baseball and it happened 3 months ago.",3,3
652,444,"When I graduated business school was a memorable day. I had worked hard in business school and my entire family came to see the occasion. I spent many nights staying up late studying. I was happy that I was done with business school but also sad that I would no longer be able to see my friends each day. I would try to still be in contact with my fellow classmates. 

I was surprised at the end of the ceremony that I was given an award for my leadership study I had done while attending the school. I did not know I was even in the running for this award. I got a medal as well as a nice certificate. I have the medal in my office to remind me of my hard work. This is a big deal for me because it will allow me to advance my career and help my family moving forward. 

I did not cry during the event but I did come close to crying many times. Anytime I think of this day I smile. It was one of the few times my entire family was together. I wish I could go back and relieve this day again.",3,3
653,445,"A memorable thing that happened to me recently is when my sister moved away. She moved from New York State to New Mexico. She is moving because there is more work out there apparently. We had to spend a lot of time helping her get her stuff ready and get it in boxes. She drove the whole way there. 

My parents and I also had to take care of her cats for a little while, while she was moving all of the stuff out of her apartment. I think a thing that really surprised me about the whole move was how upset it made my mom. She seemed really broken up that my sister was going to be so far away. 

I think my sister was glad to get away from my parents because they are kind of overbearing. I was very tired after helping her pack up and move. I wasn't very sad about her moving away because she is going to a place with more opportunity. I was kind of upset by how upset my mom was though. 

Her cats were very nice when they were staying with us but very shy. I got her a going away gift basket with some bath and body stuff and toiletries so she wouldn't have to worry about that when she moved in, and also some snacks for the road. I think she was very excited about moving away and I am somewhat jealous.",2,2
654,447,"Confirmation finally has arrived regarding my seven year old son. Four months ago, after several years of realizing he's a bit 'different' than most other children his age, the testing finally confirmed his ADHD. Am I surprised by this? No. Am I happy? Yes and no. 

Yes I'm happy that we have a diagnosis that seems consistent with what we know about the disorder. No I'm not happy that he is a child with ADHD. But, now he's treating his issue with medication. 

Unfortunately, we've gone through two different medications and have not found the right one for him. The first one has led to a weight loss that was not safe so he had to get off of it. The second one only partly seems to be working - there are still many, many issues that need addressing. 

We are continuing to meet with his doctor and to do everything we can do to help this child. This is a very emotional situation for my wife and me as for a while we thought we had a trouble maker in our home but now we realize we have a child with an actual disorder. 

Our love is endless for this child, we just want him to be able to get on with his life in the most normal way possible.",3,3
655,449,"Probably the most memorable event to happen to me recently has been finding out that I have a baby coming. I remember the day more vividly than anything else I can think of. We woke up early and she wasn't feeling well. She hadn't been feeling well for a while and we were concerned, though we knew that pregnancy was a possibility. 

By noon, she still felt like she had to throw up constantly, so we made the decision to get a pregnancy test. Since she didn't feel good, I went up to the Dollar Tree alone to get two pregnancy tests. It was a beautiful day outside so I took my time and enjoyed myself on the way there. 

I was nervous buying the pregnancy kits. I'm not sure why, because I'm an adult in my mid 30s, but it still made me feel like I was doing something I shouldn't be doing. I headed straight home with the pregnancy tests, where my wife was ready and waiting to take one. 

She took one of the boxes from me and ran into the bathroom. About a minute later, she emerged with a smile on her face and held up the test to show me the positive result. We both smiled and hugged each other. We held each other for a minute and then kissed. 

Even though we knew it was possible she was pregnant, this made it real.",3,3
656,45,"What a day , August 8, 2019, It was my 45 birthday and I thought it was going to be just like any other birthday I have had. But this day my family and friends decided to throw me a surprise party. I was in total shock, never expected s surprise party. 

It started off like a typical day waking and getting ready for work. I had plans to have dinner with my significant other that night. After work came home and got ready for dinner. 

When we got to the restaurant he provided them his name and they said that they had a special table for us in the back. The back room was usually only used for special occasions. When we walked in through the hallway to the back room it was full of my friends and family. 

We had a nice dinner and there was a DJ playing music, so we enjoyed a little dancing. I have such wonderful family and friends and getting to enjoy my 45 birthday with them was fantastic. I can't imagine having a nicer birthday. We enjoyed good food , good music and wonderful company. 

After hours of enjoying ourselves it was time to leave. I hated that the night had to end.",3,3
657,450,"I was on a vacation with my brother, and we decided to take a long road trip through New England and up to the Canadian border. We set off with only a rough destination in mind, and intending to go or do whatever caught our eye over the long drive of about a week. We stopped in many cool little towns along the way. There were really great old antique shops all over and I loved looking through the old memorabilia. 

Along the route, we were passing through Vermont, and off the side of the road we saw a beautiful grassy mountain with a waterfall cascading down the side. We thought it looked so cool, we parked and decided to hike up the mountain side a bit. It was an easy climb, but long and tiring. We stayed as close to the waterfall as we could as we went up. 

We ended up climbing all the way to the top, and got an amazing view. On the way back down we took a different route, and not far from the top, found a glistening pool where the waterfall cascaded, and then continued out the other side. It was perfect for taking a refreshing dip, and we did! It was ice cold, but really awesome. 

The rest of the trip was great. We went into little towns and ate amazing seafood. I never ate so much lobster and so many bowls of chowder in my life! It was really amazing, and there were many memorable spots. We even crossed the border into Canada and drove a ways up the coast, which was really rugged and beautiful. We visited a national park in Canada and spent one night there. 

We saw many beautiful spots, but that one dip on the mountainside in the ice cold spring water was the coolest part, and a great memory.",2,2
658,452,"The event is my younger brother's wedding. This event took place April. It was a great and memorable event for every member of my family. One of the reasons why it was memorable was because it was also a family reunion. All members of my birth family have not been in the same place together in over four years. All of us coming together for my brother's wedding was truly magnificent. 

When I traveled back to my family birth family house in anticipation of the wedding, I nearly cried. I had missed a lot. The day of the wedding was also fantastic. I was able to meet other extended family members. I was also able to meet childhood friends and family friends. We had a lot of catching up to do. 

I was surprised when I found out that two of my childhood friends were seeing each other and they already had a kid together. It was a really crazy moment for me. It made me reminisce all the time I had with them as a kid. In all honesty I never expected them together, but I believed they grew to love each other. 

The wedding ceremony was generally great for me and everybody involved.",2,2
659,454,"My wife and I went on a small, last minute vacation to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. It was in April of this year. It was a very memorable trip for me. I love spending time with my wife, and when we can get away at the last minute that just makes it that much more special. 

Gatlinburg is where we spent our honeymoon, and it has special significance to us. This time was special because we just bonded so much more than we usually do. We got to do more things because the weather was warmer this time around. We got to stay close to downtown, so we took a lot of walks together to a lot of different places. 

The most memorable part was sitting on a balcony at a restaurant overlooking the main road that goes through town. We spent hours there just talking and people watching. I still think about that afternoon and how much fun we had together just being together and not really doing anything at all. 

Besides that day, we had a couple great meals at some neat places. We also went to try a new place out that was really bad, and yet we still made the most of it. 

Overall, that trip was one of my most favorite times of my life. It was because I spent it with my favorite person I've ever met. We still talk about how we can't wait to go back, but I don't think any trip will compare to that one.",2,2
660,455,"One of the most memorable events very recently happened to me and I can't stop thinking about it. My husband and I took our first international trip together. Not only was it our first international trip together, it was also our first big trip without our two young children. We have done several small, weekend long trips but never for more than two days at the most. 

 

This time, we went to Jamaica and were gone for ten days. It was such an amazing experience. We had the opportunity to get to know each other better and become closer to each other. It has been four years since we had our oldest child. That is four years without real alone time to see who we are without being Mommy and Daddy. 

 

We got to just spend ten days in paradise having other people take care of us instead of us taking care of other people. We ate and drank and just had a great time being together. It made so much of an impact that our relationship is even stronger now than before. 

 

We have decided to book another trip to Jamaica for next year because we found the experience to just be so important and it made such a big impact on our lives. This was so surprising to me because we had to save up for quite awhile to take the trip in the first place. But with it being so good for our relationship, we decided we would find a way to be able to make it happen again in just one year.",2,2
661,456,"My wife and I traveled to Italy and did an amazing hike in the Dolomite mountain range. I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning and for about four hours we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there were loose rocks under us for much of it. 

Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally after what I figured was another false top, we came up and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us spreading for 360 degrees were what seemed like thousands of craggly mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry it was so beautiful. 

There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to traverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she suprised herself. 

It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.",3,3
662,457,"A couple of months ago in May I took my 6 year old son fishing for the first time in his life. We woke up very early in the morning eating breakfast and brushing our teeth. After doing this we loaded up the car with our fishing gear and prepared to get out on the road. We drove for almost an hour until we arrived safely at our destination. 

We ended up going to the Clearwater Pier in Clearwater, FL. Clearwater pier is a huge bridge which used to connect Clearwater to St. Pete but was shut down and later re-purposed into a fishing pier. 

The morning started out by me teaching him a few safety precautions and showing him how to tie his lines and properly setup his fishing poles. We then began to proceed to fish, the morning started out slow but eventually we began catching fish. The first fish he managed to catch was a small Jack Crevalle. I was so proud of him in this moment no words can describe how it felt watching my son catch his first fish and being able to help him do this. 

We kept fishing until lunch time catching a few fish in between. At lunch we prepared a picnic with the food supplies we had brought. Once we finished eating lunch we began fishing again catching multiple more fish each until we decided we had fished long enough. 

We packed up our gear which took around 20-30 minutes and got in the car. After getting in the car we decided to stop on the way home for hamburgers and ice cream. Once we arrived home we cleaned our fishing equipment properly and went inside to shower and relax.",2,2
663,459,"Last month, I flew from Hawaii to Tennessee to attend my little sisters wedding. I had been excited about this event all year and when the day came to head to the airport I was beyond ecstatic! I was going to get to see my Mom, both my younger sisters, and several other friends and family members I hadn't seen for years. 

I arrived in Nashville TN 6 days before the wedding so I could spend some quality time with my family and help out with the wedding. My Aunt was flying in from Utah whom I had not seen in 10 years and I was so excited to see her! I also had fun spending time with my sisters and my mom all week before the wedding. 

The day of the wedding came and boy could you feel the nerves in the air! I was a bridesmaid and also in charge of bringing my sisters dress and other supplies to the venue in the morning to get ready. I must say, I didn't know how stressful a wedding could be! There was so much to do and my sister had really bad nervousness. 

Anyways, all the bridesmaids got ready and helped my sister get ready and things were coming along nicely and it was now 2 hours before the wedding. Suddenly, my Mom came in the room saying there was a problem. It turns out the officiator was missing and no one could find him! 

A friend of the grooms was supposed to be officiating but no one could get a hold of him. Apparently he was known for being unreliable. My sister started panicking! My mom had an idea though. An old friend of the family was there and he could officiate weddings as well. I ran out to talk to him and he agreed to do it! Whew! Thank god! The wedding can go on! 

My sister looked absolutely stunning walking down the aisle and I felt so proud of her. The whole wedding was beautiful and there was not a dry eye in the house! I am so glad I was able to be part of my sisters special day and I miss everyone already.",3,3
664,46,"So I lost my job. It was so unexpected. I had been working for him for 2 and a half years. When the boss returned from his last trip, we learned the sale was never made. In fact, there weren't any sales all year. The boss continued acting normal. Until one day, he called me and told me he had to let me go. He said you can either quit which will look better on your resume or I will fire you, You choose, sign these papers. 

It all happened so fast. I grabbed my stuff and walked out. I was relieved because I couldn't stand him but I was shocked that I wasn't even given a heads up! 

It was so shocking because this boss prided himself in making a connection in his establishment, he always boasted about how much better his company was because he wasn't a corporation. Often times, tasks involved his personal life, such as taking his mom to the grocery store, or going into his house when no one was home to retrieve something for him. A few times, I had to go let his dog out. 

Still, I was let go, told to leave and I haven't returned.",2,2
665,460,"About 4 months ago I had a horrific thing happen in my life. My life will be forever changed. My dad had been sick with what everyone thought was the flu. He was throwing up and complaining of being very tired and hot. He didn't even have a fever. He had been sick for a few days, but on a Tuesday in the early evening everything quickly spiraled out of control. 

 

My mom called my husband and asked him to hurry over to the house because she thought something was wrong with my dad. He went over there and my dad was not doing well at all. He didn't know his name, where he was at and who my mom or my husband were. My mom immediately called 9-1-1. 

 

When the ambulance got there they immediately checked my dads vitals and got him loaded to rush to the hospital. They took him to the intensive care unit and got him hooked up to a million different machines to see if they could figure out what was going on with him. By this time it was late into the night on Tuesday. We were all sitting in the waiting room until more information was known. It was a very long night of millions of tests and no answers. 

 

Finally early in the morning on Wednesday a doctor came out and told my mom that my dad was suffering of kidney failure. We were all in shock because he hadn't been sick long at all. We asked what we could do and the doctor said it was too late too do anything and that if they even tried to operate he would die. The doctor could not give us a timeline of how long he would live, but that it wouldn't be more than six weeks. 

 

Well, it turns out it would be even sooner than that. By early the next morning my dad had passed away. We were all in shock because there hadn't been any warning signs and just a week ago he had been happy and hanging out with us. We were devastated and from that moment on our lives had changed forever.",3,3
666,461,"About one month ago, I received an unexpected text message from my friend. He and I had not spoken in almost two years because we had a falling out towards the end of 2017. This was a friend I made in graduate school, and with whom I used to hang out fairly regularly for about four years. We would go to the movies, go hiking, have lunch, and other things. I helped him through a particularly rough patch when he lost two people close to him and went though a breakup within a year's span. I was glad to have him as a friend and we could talk about important matters with one another. 

At one point, however, our friendship became very strained, and we had an argument, after which we didn't speak for almost two years. When I received that text (which was simply a ""Hi, how are you?""), I was very unsure about whether to respond to it or not. I put it off for a few hours, but finally decided to answer back. I did not receive a response for several days, and was not sure what happened: whether he was experiencing a major issue or just wanted to be friends again. 

When he finally texted me back several days later, it turned out he was reaching out to invite me to his wedding. He was getting married the next month, and wanted to reconnect and make amends. I was taken aback because I had not expected to ever hear from him again. I was cautious about going, but decided to accept his invitation after consulting with a few people about whether it would be a good idea. 

The wedding was in just a few weeks, so it was short notice, and this would be the first time we were seeing each other in almost two years. I was afraid it would be awkward or tense. Luckily, the wedding was a beautiful occasion, and I was glad I went and was able to reconnect with him after all this time. His wife is a very intelligent and lovely woman, and I am happy for him, especially after the difficult time he went through.",2,2
667,462,"About three months ago i was involved in a very serious car wreck. I was on my way home from work when a large white truck hit me from the side at an intersection. The truck ran a red light because they were falling asleep at the wheel. I never even saw the truck coming so i was surprised when I was struck. It was around 6:30 am when this happend so the roads were pretty empty at first. I remember hearing the crash but not really seeing it and then kind of just realizing i was hit. 

When i gathered myself i started to get out of the car and notice two people walking towards me asking if i was doing OK. It turns out one of the people that i was talking to was the person that hit me and they seemed very scared and apologetic. It took maybe about 10 minutes for the police to arrive and take our statements and make a report for us. My car had to be towed off the scene. 

I would later find out that it was a total loss. I was a little upset though to see there was little to no damage to the truck that hit me. lucky i wasn't too far from home so i ended up just walking the rest of the way there. 

On the way home i still felt a little shaken up and even almost nervous as if i was in trouble. The whole event was a bit scary to me since i had never been in a car accident before but i was just happy to be safe. I now own a truck for the safety features it has because my little car didn't stand a chance. I now also notice that i drive slower through intersections without even thinking about it.",2,2
668,463,"I have great memories of our family trip to Chicago, Illinois. It actually had an odd beginning. My daughter had complained to our mutual employer (in Chicago) that she had never flown in an airplane and that it was the only item on her bucket list. The next week, they offered to fly us out for a meeting and a lunch with them! I decided to take the entire family and make a nice little vacation out of it. 

We had a fantastic visit with my employers. After a short meeting, they took us to a great Greek restaurant where I tried several new foods. From there, we went to our hotel which was located in the heart of the city. 

We visited an architecture museum and learned a lot about the origins of the city. We also went to see The Bean, which is a chrome bean that is absolutely enormous and sits in the middle of a park. We went to the Navy Pier and had some great food. 

The highlight (or perhaps the lowlight) of the trip was our lunch where we ate traditional Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza was unreal- so thick and cheesy! Even though I was starving I could only eat a single slice. But just as we were eating, the city got hit with a tremendous thunderstorm. I have never encountered anything like it before. It was downright traumatizing though fortunately, it passed quickly. 

We wrapped up the short trip after another day of museum hopping and shopping. Although I could have spent another week in the city, I feel fortunate to have enjoyed the time I did with my family.",2,2
669,464,"Just a few months ago I was able to go to my best friend's daughter's first birthday party. This was very exciting for me because this is my first close friend to have a child while I have two already and another that is due soon. Because we have been so busy since adulthood, her with work, and me being a mom, working, and going to school, it was a great opportunity to get together. 

My daughter was especially excited because she was really wanting the new baby to be a girl, but it is not. She has that opportunity to spend time with a baby girl. Even though they are not actually family, me and my friend have always been so close that the kids will be raised more like cousins than friends. 

I also got to see her family for the first time in a while which was nice. It felt like 'coming home.' This family is one that I have spent many holidays with over the years, including major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas that you typically spend with family. There were no other friends of the family at the party, it was only family members and that made me feel quite warm. 

It also was the first time I got to see my friends new house. She had been living with her spouse and baby at her mom's house since she was pregnant and it was very exciting to see them moving out and being more independent. While I love her family, it is always good to have your own space as an adult. 

I really look forward to our kids growing up together and couldn't be happier still. We even talked about having sleepovers with my 6 year old daughter and her 1 year old. I am feeling so excited about the future after this party.",3,3
670,465,"Today something amazing happened. I was at home with my son and my wife was at work like she always is. We were watching TV in the living room just like any other ordinary day. All of a sudden my infant son stood up for the first time and started taking a few steps. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen and it made me want to break down in tears. 

This was a huge milestone in his development and I think It should go down in history. Can’t wait to tell his mom when I see her later. It makes me so happy to see him grow up and reach these points. He is looking more like a grown-up every day as he begins to develop. 

I think he is ahead of the average child and so these things are very important in assessing his development and advancement because we want him to be at the top of his class. These things are so important to me because family is so important to me and he is the most important part of my family. I have joys and sorrows vicariously through him and devote my life to making his better. 

I really want the best for him and life these things make me so happy because they show me that I’m succeeding in some importance. I think other people should find the same joy. 

I can’t wait until his next stage when he begins to run around And ride his bicycle or tricycle. He will be climbing trees and getting his drivers license in enough time.",3,3
671,466,"During the last school year, I was forced to homeschool my two oldest children as the Christian school they used to attend closed. With public school out of the question (poor quality and too much liberal propaganda, thank you very much), I had to homeschool. Now, having to homeschool was something I dreaded even before my children were born. I hate teaching. I think everyone should do their job, the one they trained for. Well, I never trained for teaching, and let's say I'm not a natural. 

Anyway, somehow I'd made it through the year. I learned to enjoy some parts of it, and my children made progress, but for the most part, I still hated it, and I'm afraid it showed. So when the year was over, I sat there and wondered what I was going to do next school year. I couldn't imagine homeschooling AGAIN, yet there seemed to be no other options. 

I checked other Christian and private schools in the area - way too expensive. I kept thinking about it, same thoughts circling in my mind. I went to get mail - and there was a letter from my kids' old school in the mailbox! At first, I thought maybe it was about some old bill I forgot to pay. I opened it... and I couldn't believe my eyes! 

It said the school was re-opening! With slightly lowered rates, too!! How do I describe this terrible weight instantly lifting off my shoulders? No more darn teaching!! My children will get to experience a normal classroom, teachers, and schoolmates. I was SO happy.",3,3
672,467,"I recently had a poem of mine published in a literary magazine. As someone who has been writing poetry my whole life, this is huge. I only started submitting my work within the last year, and have been published in many underground publications. However, more recently, I was published in a more established magazine. 

My friends threw me a congratulatory party, and it blew me away. My party was hosted at a beach house. They had decorated it all pink, and with my initials everywhere. They even cut out and framed my poem and pasted it everywhere. Bits of my writing were adorned throughout the house and the yard. 

It was also themed! They had it themed around tea parties, which I love. They purchased all sorts of unique teas, including blooming tea. I had never seen blooming tea before, and was amazed, as I love flowers as well. 

Overall, I had a blast at this party where we all celebrated something very meaningful to me. I am so proud of myself, and I just have the best friends ever. I am so glad that they not only enjoy my work, but love me enough to do something like this for me.",2,2
673,468,"Two months ago, I drove to a few cities in the east coast for a summer campus visit with my kids. My kids are ready going to their college in the next few years. We scheduled for 9 university information sessions and the corresponding campus tours during this trip. We have greatly enjoyed this impressive and informative trip. 

We directly contactedthe teachers and students from these universities and learned a lot of new information about our interested university. This was a very important visit for my kids to prepare their university applications later on. As their parents, we also felt this visit was very helpful for us to prepare for the coming important events.

We learned how to start the preparations for the promising universities earlier. My son has been aiming on his dream school, MIT, because his friends went to this school. I helped him to sort the candidate majors out and went through the admission pages carefully. After talked with the teachers and students there, my son recognized what were his strengths and weaknesses. He said he would start preparations of his standardized testsearlier. He has made a detail plan for the next 3 years for this endeavor. 

I thought that it would be better for a family to arrange this kind of campus visit more earlier, i.e. 3 years prior to the university application. This kind of activities obviously encouraged my kids to be more active on their studies. As parents, we also could help them in more specific manners instead of non-focused ways. 

Through these visits, my kids had their direct experiences with the university campus life. We learned more detail about their interested majors in the candidate universities instead of just numbers such as acceptance rate and university ranking. We would narrow down the school list and re-visit some of them in the future. 

In summary, this trip was a very important for us to help the kids to prepare their college application in the coming years.",1,1
674,47,"The story is about when my daughter gave birth to her first child. My daughter had been married for some years. She and her husband have been trying to get a child but things were not working as expected. She was able to conceive last year and she was able to give birth to her child in May. Since she stayed in the same state as I do, I decided to be with her on the day she went into labor. 

That day was very hectic and scary for everybody involved. I think immediately she went into labor, her husband called me and then drove her to the hospital. I joined her at the hospital. When we got the hospital things became a little bit complicated. Her husband tried his best to be with her and to keep her strong. She eventually delivered perfectly. 

After delivery, she had to stay at the hospital for a while. Back at her home, I had been planning a surprise return for her. It was expected that the surprise return party would make her feel happy. Finally, she was discharged from the hospital. When she got home, and saw the surprise return party she just burst into tears. According to her a tsunami of emotions engulfed her at that moment. Her husband couldn't help but started crying as well. It was beautiful to watch and really emotional.",3,3
675,470,"It's been two months since my father's heart surgery. Driving him and my mother to and from the hospital (and to and from the months of tests preceding the surgery) were stressful, but ultimately bonding. We do not normally travel well together, under casual circumstances. So, the trips with my father's health in question only added to the possibility of argument and tempers. 

I filled in the role of caretaker during these trips and waiting room experiences, being the only one who could manage their stress adequately enough to manage the one hour of interstate traffic both ways. It was a role I felt forced to take on, but I was also grateful to have some sort of way to repay my parents for times they had supported me in stressful situations. 

We learned to set more trivial elements of road trip stress aside. And we even went on some trips in between hospital visits to help relax. I learned that while I can handle the thought of my parents falling ill, or even dying, my mother's views on death have changed. She was the person who taught me to see death as just another part of life. But now that she's getting closer to old age, she seems to fear it. 

The subject is one that can't be just theoretical. I guess people don't know how they'll react until the subject is staring them in the face. For some reason it bothered me how stressed my mother got. She seemed to jump to the worst conclusions. 

In the end, however, dad was fine, and her stress seemed wasted.",3,3
676,471,"One day before my 36th birthday of 2019, I woke up that morning in horrible abdominal pain. I didn't know then but this would be a changing day in my life. Not sure what it was, I spent a good portion of the day in the bathroom crying and throwing up. My girlfriend convinced me to let her take me to the emergency room and when I got there the pain was so bad the doctor had to give me morphine. 

The doctor had me do a ton of tests that night and into the next day with the conclusion being that this was a flareup caused by Crones Disease. My jaw dropped. I was then told this is a chronic disease and that my lifestyle would dramatically have to be altered if I am to have any type of life whatsoever. 

This news hit me like a ton of bricks. No longer would I be able to devour a t-bone steak for dinner or wash it down with alcohol or any type of soda for that matter. I would have to eat healthy and be observant of my meals. I would have to read nutrition labels and stay away from red meats. All of this overwhelmed me as I sat in the hospital bed taking it all in. 

What I most remember about this day was thinking to myself, "" All of those years my mom told me to eat healthy and I ignored her!"" I have never had to deal with an actual disease I have! This whole event scares me even now. I know this is a chronic disease and its hard to manage now, let alone years down the road.",3,3
677,473,"When growing up my sister were not on the best of terms during our childhood. I would theorize it could have been mostly due to competition for the affection of our parents. I was the second child...she was the first. She was the one with stellar grades all throughout her education, from kindergarten all the way through her prestigious university years. She is now a professional musician in an orchestra as well as a music teacher. 

Growing up I tended to be a rather mediocre student. I am confident that I am intelligent, I just never have had the drive to excel. Perhaps because I knew devoting a great deal of energy to ""competing"" with my sister would not only be futile, but absolutely exhausting. I have always been one to get lost in my thoughts and I prefer to be in nature to feel truly alive. 

That is why it was so memorable that a few months ago my mother told me that recently my sister told her that she only knows particular symphonies because she would hear me playing them in my room, next door to hers. I did not even know she was listening to the music I was playing, I always pictured her diligently reading and/or practicing the various instruments with which she is now proficient. 

After hearing that from my mother I actually felt a rush of pride. Not only was I absorbing and getting lost in the extraordinary music, but I was also influencing my orchestral musician sister. 

To add to that, the other day, she called me up about a certain composer because, as she put it, I am a ""musicologist of sorts."" (In addition to listening to music, I would study biographical information about the various composers to whom I listened. 

Back in my childhood days, I never would have dreamed that I would be having an unintended influence on my rather brilliant sister. It just goes to show that perceptions of the moment are not always accurate...it helps to get perspective outside of your own head.",2,2
678,476,"On September 9, I met this guy who worked in same outlet as me. We automatically had a connection and I realized that I had a crush on him. Last Saturday, before I went to work, I decided to hit my shot and gave him a note that said ""Hey, I dont mean to be a creep (sorry if I am) but I think youre kind of cute"". 

Before I gave him the note, he said that he always wanted to visit my store that I work in because I always visit his. It wasn't until around close to closing time that he actually visited (which actually shocked me because I thought he wasn't going to come today). We talked a little bit, and he gave me back the note after I apologized to him for being a creep. 

I actually thought that he gave it back because he didn't want it, but it wasn't until I saw the reply on the back after he left. The reply said ""[My Name], you are cute too! I do have a gf but we can still hang out if you want"". Under that note he gave me his number, so I am at a state where I am kind of heartbroken but kind of conflicted at the same time. 

After I showed it to my twin sister, I got the happy flutters again because I don't know if this guy actually has feelings for me. I dont know what to do and I feel stupid and cringy.",3,3
679,477,"I had unintentionally gained some weight this past year (I went from about 160 pounds to 235 pounds from last Summer 2021 to April this year (and I'm 510). The medical school at my university sometimes has sign-ups for participants in some of their particular studies and trials for reimbursement. 

I saw that they were doing a study on weight gain in young adults and any students who had recently gained weight were encouraged to apply. I was picked, actually, for a particular study concerning abdominal obesity/stomach girth in young males and how certain diets may or may not contribute to this kind of weight gain. 

Apparently my statistics of height versus weight versus age versus abdominal circumference put me at the highest threshold for that ratio; they want to see how far that can be taken. 

I started as a participant at the end of April and I'm about 260 pounds now (+25 pounds in about 2.5 months). I'm reimbursed for all of my food (+$500 at every bimonthly check-in) and need to follow a strict diet that changes every 2 weeks (and go in for measurements at the end of these periods) - two weeks focused on red meat, 2 on carbs, 2 on keto, 2 with lots of dairy, etc. 

I really could use the extra money, I'm saving tons of money on food and groceries, and I was already putting on a bit of weight as it was. Since I apparently gain weight in such a specific way, which is why I was picked, I'm glad I can help science/medicine somehow.",1,1
680,48,"One of the worst days of my life, my beloved Border Terrier, Mr. Pip, has passed away. He has been suffering from Cushings disease for the past 2 years, but his quality of life over the past 6 months has gone down. He has had frequent accidents in the house and appears to have some type of dementia. Also, he cannot seem to get enough water. 

We have resisted putting him on meds because of the potential side effects, but finally it seemed there was no other alternative. We put him on the meds and for the 1st couple of weeks, things seemed to get better. Then, in a matter of 24 hours, all of his organs started to shut down. 

I brought the kids to school and something told me I should go home to check on him. I will never forget that image. He was lying down and foaming at the mouth, he looked terrified. I am so upset that I ever put him on those meds. 

I carried him to our van and brought him to the vet. He was put to sleep and died in my arms. I will hold the guilt for a long time.",3,3
681,485,"My music taste has definitely changed as I grew up, but there are a few songs that always invoke feelings of nostalgia when time was much more peaceful and enjoyable. One of these songs is called ""Bubbly"" by Colbie Caillat, and I heard it playing today at Trader Joes while I was buying some groceries.It was such a weird and nostalgic experience, and I stuck around even after I paid to listen to the full thing play out. 

I remember being in kindergarten where we had a designated ""nap time"" and the teacher would always play this song softly in the background. I remember being picked up by mom and going to get a snack after school with this song playing in the radio. 

It was so weird realizing that all of this happened and is a part of me, and I know that sounds really dumb, but it's just grounding to notice how far you've come with everything. I'm now in college away from that easy going life of a little kindergartner, where all I had to worry about was what outdoor game me and my friends would play or what fun things I would do with my family over the weekend. 

It's just crazy to me how times change, but at the end of it all, I'm still me. It's even more crazy to me how just a simple 3 minute song made me have so many thoughts at the same time.",3,3
682,486,"I'm a follower and I like it. One of the best feelings for me is when someone I trust is in charge of the situation. I like to be present and participate in taking decisions but I'm okay with not being the most smart or capable person in the room and letting others make the final choice. 

A small example would be, I was on a walk with 3 friends the other week. I was one step behind my friend and when crossing the street I would sort of wait for him to take the first step. Or when there was a car coming he said ""Careful."" Of course I wouldn't have crossed but it felt nice, not necessarily ""being taken care of"" more like ""cared for"" or I don't know how to explain it. Safe. And obviously I can cross the street by myself but it felt nice to have a leader. 

This is just one side of it, but the feeling applies to almost all kinds of situations. I still want to be independent and prove to myself that I'm able to make it on my own, but I think that if I find a person I can really trust I would be a real ride or die, like if you want me I'll follow you to the end of the world. I'm sure this is pretty common but it's something I've understood about myself in the past year. I struggle with commitment but I'm finally growing and learning. 

I was always taught to make my own way and stand my ground and that's good advice but for me it makes more sense to be in the supporting role. I'm the occasional helper, that character that you take care of and in return they tag along and carry the bags. I still worry about being a burden though.",2,2
683,488,"This afternoon, a delivery driver dropped a lunch order and knocked on the door and left. Probably the person who ordered chose contactless delivery. I peeked and saw him leave quickly so I thought maybe he knocked on the wrong door. 

I was planning to go out to grab lunch and he hung the lunch order at the door handle. I checked the receipt attached, called the shop, they said they cant see the unit number of the person who ordered nor the contact number of delivery guy. And that person already made another order. 

So I initiated a chat with live agent through the delivery app. I gave them the order number, driver name and the shop name. She said she can't trace it back as the order wasn't mine and wasn't made under my account. And told me to just consume the food if the driver doesn't come back in 30 minutes. 

I obviously ate the lunch because it was just hanging at the door and I was about to grab lunch either way and the rain started conveniently. I feel bad for the person who ordered although they'll likely get a refund. I feel guilty still for eating someone's lunch. But it was too good to just let it go to waste outside my door. It's hot and humid here. 

Thank you destiny, thank you fate, thank you person who ordered and thank you delivery person (hope you don't get penalised hard). Thanks for the food.",2,2
684,491,"For the past 15 years or so, my ultimate goal has been to buy a house in the country with some property so that I can build my life from there forward. 8 years ago, I found the place I wanted to be but it was unattainable at the time, so I moved to the city with my goal in mind, and spent 7 years working hard to achieve it. Last year, I finally achieved it. I now have my own one acre property in the area I love so much. 

But since the initial awe of being here wore off at about this time last year, I've been experiencing such an intense downward spiral into severe depression and anxiety, with no end in sight. The past month has been one of the worst ever, between losing a close family member, my dog getting diagnosed with cancer, losing my glasses, tearing my ACL, fighting with my partner often, and so much more. 

I've been seriously contemplating whether or not I would make it through winter, a time when I've historically experienced depression already. But I just had the realization that since I've been here, I reached my ultimate goal. And I don't really know where to go from here. I don't have any goals, I don't know what to do next or what I even want to do. I've just been struggling to maintain with no purpose. 

Obviously having this realization isn't going to fix everything, but I think I just took a step forward. I'm going to see about getting into therapy soon as well. I just feel such a lightness with realizing how important it is for me to have something to work toward. I'm gonna have to sit down and really figure out what I actually want to do.",3,3
685,497,"I'm very independent, been dating around for a little bit here and there. I'm a comedian/ filmmaker and I'm almost always busy, which is why I never prioritize dating anyone. In the past I've always dated other creatives-- musicians, filmmakers, comics, etc. However, I always felt like I was in their limelight and they never truly believed in me. I always felt like a ""groupie"" of sorts. 

But it's only been a couple weeks since I came across this guy, and I feel like my whole world has changed. The first night we met, we walked around the city for about 6 hours, just talking about our past and future ideas, making jokes, and even coming up with our own sketches on the spot. I never had that immediate of a connection with anyone. He watched some of my short films (on his own time) and told me he's making it a goal of his to showcase my talents. For the first time, I'm with someone whom I feel truly believes in me. 

Now, I've been in love before, been in relationships, flings, the whole nine yards. They've always felt very disposable to me though, like in my head they all had an expiration date. But with him, I'm already fantasizing about the future, which is something I've never done with anyone.",3,3
686,5,"I have lived in Connecticut my entire life, 48 long years. A beautiful state convenient to the east coast beaches as well as the cities of New York and Boston. The fall foliage is amazing. There are so many quaint towns to visit, many with historical significance. The state parks are wonderful to visit, many with beautiful rivers and lakes. 

These are some of the positives but there are also many negatives. Including extremely high taxes, outrageous home prices, cold winters and abundance of people I like to call uptight. 

Wanting a change of scenery and financial status I decided in June of this year to relocate to North Carolina. The weather is fantastic, taxes are low and the overall cost of living is much cheaper. It was the best decision of my life, I absolutely love it here! There are beautiful beaches, lots of activities and the people are so down to earth. 

The packing was hard work and very emotionally taxing. It's not easy to change your entire life. The move was also and continues to be a financial hardship but things are getting better. It has been 4 months and I wouldn't change a thing. 

I have a job, I am saving money and enjoying my life. I do miss my friends and family members but they are all welcome to visit. I am close to Myrtle Beach and would love to take them to see some of the attractions. I'm sure they would enjoy it here as much as I do.",2,2
687,502,"I last saw them July, and since then both of our lives have went up into the air and everything seems so uncertain. The only definite thing for me right now is that I want them in my life, which isn't looking too hopeful to keep true. 

Their life is getting busier, and incredibly complicated. My life has kind of just been disasters after disasters. Everything seems right, peaceful, and honestly like home when I'm with them. 

Yet the next time I'm hopefully able to see them is going to be anywhere between 6 months and year. Not being able to afford the plane tickets due to losing my job (I'm now on the perilious hunt for another one), family complications, housing situations, and anything else that'd like to pile onto the list. 

I suppose I'm just here to vent, I'm just missing my other heart so much lately. Their comfort is unmatched and it's cruel that they live so far away. 

I think my existentialism is leading me into overthinking, and I'm fearing they're drawing away from me, but both of our lives are drifting us apart. Which I guess is another factor making me so desperate to see them again, in fear that they'll leave me in time as their love may fade the longer we're apart. 

They call me usually once their day is finished and I hear all about their days, usually filled with adventures I'm missing out on and I simply think ""I wish I could be there"", everything we've talked about doing together. I feel so distant some days. 

I love them with my entire heart, and I know they love me too, but I feel selfish asking them to wait for unguaranteed plans and dates for my next visit. It's so painful being apart.",3,3
688,506,"It's become clear to me that I lack confidence in myself. It's in everything I say, and everything that I do. I always feel blocked because I'm unwilling to push the boundaries in my life. I know intellectually that I need to be more assertive and confident, but after so many years of being this way, its become habitual. 

I paid attention to how I talk to others and my speech is filled with words and phrases that scream ""I'm weak, please don't respect me"". It's like I'm always shielding myself from backlash and punishment and rejection by being this way. And so I can only resort to passive aggressiveness, the occasional scathing remark, but I'm mostly just sulking. 

And I don't want to be this way anymore. I feel weak, disempowered, and fragile, even when I know deep down I'm the opposite. It's begun to really get to me, to the point where I've started to think I'm slowly going mad because my toxicity is starting to leak out. 

I can't keep this up. I will crack and explode eventually. So, really, I need help. I need to know where I can go and what I can do to fix this. I want this hell to end. I want to feel like I've got a spine. I want to be strong and feel like I have power to create change or at the very least push back when someone is messing with me. 

I cannot keep living my life like this because I'm not only making my life harder, but the lives of everyone around me too.",3,3
689,507,"I am really thinking about this idea that whatever happens, happens for a good reason and in the end everything will work out in my favor. Why I started thinking like this? Recently I got a random thought that the thing I like to do now which even earns me some good money, happened just because I failed my exams. 

I knew about this thing since September 2020 and ignored it, I gave my papers in December that year, results came in February and I failed and gave again at the end of July. Having a good amount of free time in August 2021 I decided to finally look into it and since then it has changed me forever. Now if I would have passed my exams I doubt I could have even thought of this thing because I had other things to do in February and later got busy with other exams. 

After thinking this I realized more things, because of failing that exams and delaying my progress for 6 months I found so many better people and had so many great experiences which I would have not had if I cleared it 6 months ago, like there were covid restrictions 6 months before I did this so any chance of meeting new people at that time goes to zero. And my old self couldn't have even possibly imagined it, this thing I didn't even think was possible in real life and now that it's in real life its like 100 times better. I can't be more grateful for failing that exam. 

Pros I have realized while thinking this way: 

1. Excited for the future even when going through bad times. 

2. Always trying to figure out how this bad things turn out to be good for me. 

3. Less complaining and more grateful. 

Cons I have realized: 

1. You get lazy, won't work too hard, like what's the reason if it will turn out in my favor. 

2. Day dreaming a lot. 

3. Family and Friends might think you have given up on life. 

Anyways this is what I think. Some might say that you would have got all this even if you passed, but the timing of it, everything seems so perfect I can't see myself doing any of this if I passed.",2,2
690,509,"I've been sick the past 4 days, and while I was supposed to go to university today I woke up late and decided that skipping an extra day won't hurt. Since I happened to still wake up I decided I will still treat myself to a good day. 

I went to McDonald's and ordered a Menu and ate there. That was a first for me. I've always been scared of going to restaurants alone because I will look dumb or whatever, but now I no longer care what others think and I enjoyed a good ol' meal. 

After that I went to a cafe to do my homework, which is also something I've been horrified doing, because I thought ""people will think I'm trying to look mature"" or whatever, but now I don't care. I went and ordered a piece of cheesecake as well as a cup of hot coffee and did some math homework. 

It was a really relaxing atmosphere and the mood was just awesome. I didn't spend all my time on homework because it's a waste of time to not enjoy the moment in that atmosphere and do math instead. Anyhow, it was also awesome. 

And I'm happy that I now don't care what others think. I don't take comfort in knowing ""they don't think badly of you"", I am comfortable because ""even if they think badly of me, I don't care"". 

And now I have a lot to catch up on for university, but it was worth it.",2,2
691,51,"Today my family gathered in a small town. It has been years since we have all been in the same place at the same time. Usually seeing long lost relatives is a joyous occasion for most families. We aren't most families. Usually, we don't all get along. 

Today wasn't usual. Today we gathered to pay our respect to one of the most complicated men most of us have ever known. Today, we all supported each other and consoled one another in the name of my Dad. 

My dad passed away a week ago and today was his memorial. This has been a difficult week. Trying to grasp the fact that he is gone has been tough, but today was the worst. We had an open casket. He looked so strange, it was him and yet not him 

I watched as some of my family broke down into tears, some quietly. Others held it in. I felt I had to be strong for my own little family. My children will never again get to see their grandpa. I will never again get to see my dad, yet as a dad, I couldn't let me kids watch me break down completely. 

After today, all that will be left him is his belongings and his ashes.",3,3
692,52,"An emotional event happened to me about five months ago. I broke up with my first girlfriend of almost four years. It was a traumatic experience, one that I keep thinking back to and realizing that I have grown a lot since then but that also things will never be the same again. I often catch myself thinking where things went wrong, specifically, why I did what I did. 

While we were long distance for a few months, I went to see an escort. When we met up again, I was quite distraught and eventually couldn't shoulder what I did. I went online to find what others have done in a similar situation and one night, I was driven to confess thinking it would rid my guilty conscience and that if we were to have a successful relationship, it had to start over somehow. I told her what I did and I only remember how disappointed she was. She only cried a little bit and before the week was over, we had broken up. She realized I made immature decisions and hoped that maybe if we met again in New York, we could get back together again. 

On hindsight, maybe she was letting me down easy. For the first month after the break up, I was extremely stressed. I would go to sleep at around 4AM and wake up at around 1PM. I felt like I lost a part of me. We had spent a lot of time together over the four years, almost every living minute. But we both realized we couldn't be together given what had happened. 

So I spent a lot of time trying to bury what happened. I was completely unsure of why I did what I did and the most shocking thing was that how unexpected everything was. Yet, everything came crashing down in the span of a week. I lost a lot of hair in the following few months after this, a condition called telogen effluvium, diagnosed by doctors. 

Still now, I feel like I don't understand my actions and by extension, myself.",3,3
693,521,"I'm 26, have a bachelor's degree in math, but I burned out of my master's program before finishing. I crashed and burned my last semester and don't even know how I'd get back into university if I wanted. Anything academic-related that I like doesn't have good career outlooks, e.g. pure math, history, humanities. Only real obligation is my vehicle payment and whatever I spend on living every month. 

I work at a paper mill as a production operator. The people suck, the job is okay but not intellectually fulfilling. It's just do this, that. Part of me wants to learn a trade, but part of me wants to go back to college. I'm stuck in an identity crisis mixed with heavy indecisiveness. 

I chose the wrong path in grad school and it cost me two years of my life and I'm scared any decision I make will end up being the wrong one. I'm making decent money at my job, and I'd hate to give it up for another that won't work out. I was raised blue collar, but feel much more at home culturally within certain sects of academia, which is a big part of the identity crisis. 

For the last two months or so, I've been trying to figure out what I want to do, but I've gotten nowhere and just go through the day to day grind hoping one day I'll miraculously have some vision of what I should do. A professor I knew went through something similar for a few years--a period he referred to as ""the lost years."" 

If I could do it again, I think I'd choose academia, but between the bad grades and shame of my 2nd year of grad school plus not being poor for the first time in 26 years, I don't even know if that's an option.",3,3

I went to the local Walmarts and publixes and there's no water! I feel like I couldn't even prep if I could afford to. Honestly I wish I had the money for just even one of these little hurricane kits I'm seeing on the news. I'm just stressed. 

And what also is going to piss me off is when I'm here and I'm stuck I always see people victim blaming online after these kinds of disasters. People say they had time they should've just left town. Not everyone can afford it. If I can't afford to go get a bunch of cases of water and a flashlight, what makes you think that I can afford to leave town and stay at a hotel?!?

695,530,"She moved across the country and for the last year we've remained really close and she would always be the first person I'd want to talk to and vice versa. But lately there's been a shift in our relationship and I just don't feel like she actually cares or is interested in me as a person anymore. 

We used to talk all day everyday about anything and now she only engages in conversation if it's for advice or for her to rant about something that's bothering her. I try to engage in more light hearted conversations and she immediately switched the topic to be about her. And she always says she has my back and I can tell her anything but as of lately I don't feel comfortable approaching her with anything that's bothering me because she either ignores me or switches the conversation. 

The thing that really bothered me and I think started the shift was when I was going through a rough time and really needed a friend to talk to. I tried telling her about some things that were bothering me and she said it wasn't healthy for me to be so negative and that I should see a specialist or doctor - so it's okay for her to complain to me daily about her issues but tells me I should find a specialist? That rubbed me the wrong way especially from someone I've built a lot of trust with. 

I'm just feeling like we're drifting apart and I can't keep putting in the effort for a one sided friendship. I'm afraid that will just be the end of the friendship.",3,3

I've spent the last 26 years of my life driving up to 16 hours (in one day) one way to travel to other states. I was always given horror stories about airports from my relatives- my GOD they make you take off your shoes! 

Finally my husband and I decided to go to Vegas and there's no way we're driving because last time we drove on vacation 16 hrs he got a blood clot and had to be on blood thinners for three months. As a 30 year old. 

So we go via some podunk airline and the whole process is just....super painless. We get in and out of security quick, bag checked super quick, boarded super quick. The wayeveryone made it sound was like a 4 hour process! Nope.

There was a tiny dog being chased by a large dog on the side of the road and I pulled over and chased the big dog away and scooped up the little dog. I remember the little dog shaking so hard and just being terrified and holding her close to me and feeling her breathing finally slowed just a bit and her shaking stopped just a little bit. She would definitely have been attacked if I had not scooped her up. 

I took her home with me and then the next day took her to the vet. She was not chipped. But I reached out on Facebook. And finally the owner contacted me. I was able to reunite her with her owners. 

It turns out that the people who were watching her thought that she had come in and locked up and left. But she was still outside. It was a joyous feeling to see her so happy reunited with her owners everyone was crying it was a great experience.",3,3
698,544,"There was once a time I thought I ""broke the internet"" as they say. My mom used to use a certain Reddit rival site called DeviantArt. She used it for four years, making it to comment on the wedding of my two best friends, but slowly forgot about it over time. 

One day I wanted to sign up. I had heard of an award on the website called the senior membership award, they are given to exceptional users but there are people (including me at the time) who think they're given based on account age, so I asked my mom for her account instead of making my own. She said yes. That day, a habit was born. 

My sisters and their relatives would use this as reason for them to ask me to let them borrow my account rather than them making their own, since DeviantArt would consider their email addresses invalid. It became a shared account, and then the habit spread to all our accounts across the internet as a sort of ""you borrow this I borrow that"" chain reaction, so all our accounts are shared accounts. 

What has always confused me are certain people who devoutly see it as a social norm that one username always equals one person. A digital possession is like any possession... especially in my native culture in the world which is hypercommunal (people share everything else, can't remember a day I didn't share pet food). Is it not? There are websites where many accounts have one owner, but people raise an eyebrow at one account having many owners.",1,1
699,546,"I was born and brought up in the US, though my parents are minorities from Asia. Although I've been to a few European countries a few years ago, I went to Netherlands and Belgium for the first time. I had some reservations about Europe being racist and unfriendly, but I was pleasantly surprised by a number of things: 

1. People seemed actually a bit more culturally aware than the US. I was surprised to see even small cities/towns have decent minority populations. In the US, it feels like you only see cultural diversity in very few cities and even of those few, it feels far more segregated in some places. 

2. Public transportation and dedicated biking lanes-I knew the US is generally bad at this except in NYC, but I didnt realize just how inadequate our transportation is in comparison. I was surprised even small cities in Netherlands have public transportation and dedicated walking and biking paths. In US, most cities/towns arent walkable-though you can find nature, you have to often drive to a park or something to really walk. 

Overall culture seemed so much more relaxed and less disconnected because of the way housing and transportation was set up. Granted I was only there for a week, so I can't say much about what the people or life is like, but I visited because a family member went for a business trip and they felt the work life there was less toxic. 

I've heard Europe is less friendly than US, but as a minority I don't feel people are all too friendly, some are extremely ignorant. I've found it harder to make and keep friends as I get older, either because people are way too busy with work and/or making friends is contingent on things like appearances and popularity. It feels very hard to find friends who are interested in learning about things for the sake of learning and not money or status.",1,1
700,55,"My grandma in Oregon passed away a couple weeks ago. The process was painful to hear about and it hit me harder than I thought it would. I was very close with my grandma and so was my mom. My mom's siblings put her on Hospice about three weeks ago and within a week she was gone. 

There was a lot of family drama over the passing of her and I did not agree with with how she was taken care of in the end. I feel she was pushed into the direction of death by being heavily medicated and her family members that were there were not getting her up out of bed anymore. I realize people get old and everyone's time comes but I feel like it wasn't her time yet. But you can't go back in time and she's gone now. 

I was able to travel with my parents and sister to Oregon to attend her funeral. It was an emotional roller coaster. The hardest day for me was when the day before her funeral I found out that there had been rules put in place by my Uncle that no grand kids were going to be able to go view my grandma and say goodbye. Because of all the drama, he wanted to hurt everyone he could that wasn't on his side. 

I went to the funeral home with my parents anyway in hopes that I might still get a chance. After arguing with the funeral director, it was decided that I would not be able to go in the room. I was crushed, I was so hurt and upset but I was trying to hold it together for my mom. 

My mom was able to go in for a while and sit with her mom so I waited outside with other family members. After some time, my mom came outside in a hurry and told me to come quickly. I didn't know what had happened but apparently the funeral director had a change of heart and decided to go against the request of my Uncle and let me go view my Grandma. 

Walking in that room was so surreal. I couldn't believe my beloved grandma was laying there in her coffin. I never thought it would bother me as much as it did. I couldn't even bring myself to touch her, I guess I was scared or in denial. 

It was an emotional couple of weeks to say the least.",3,3
701,550,"I remember being a kid and seeing those dating shows and they were always asked, ""What would we do on our first date?"" In my opinion the answers were always so cheesy, they were usually along the lines of...""Well, first we'd go out to a romantic candlelit dinner, drink some fine wine and share dessert. After dinner we'd take in a movie and follow that up with a slow walk on the beach and talk until the sun comes up."" 

I have so many problems with this 'traditional version' of a first date. Here's what I did when I had a date planned with a girl I was interested in and I knew she was at least a little interested in me. I didn't have the funds for some expensive candlelit dinner, I took her to one of those old school pizza places where every table has a little jukebox and you can play 3 songs for a quarter. I ordered a pitcher of lite beer, a medium half cheese and half sausage pizza. I figured, if this goes badly, I won't be out too much money and if we like each other, it will be fun no matter what we did. 

So we drank the beer and ate pizza and played some of our favorite songs (turns out we had similar taste in music) Then we took turns playing Galaga to see who could get a higher score. Ended up being a good move, she kept touching my arm trying to mess me up, so I did the same when it was her turn, it was good for some flirting. 

Instead of going to a movie (which by the way is dumb, you have to spend two hours of your date not talking or getting to know each other) I took her to a mini-putt place. We had a blast, laughing and chatting the evening away, she won (or maybe I duffed a few strokes) and she gloated. 

At the end of the night, I told her I had a great time and I would love to see her again, and she said the same. I found out later on that when she talked to her parents that weekend, she told them ""I went on a date with the man I am going to marry."" We've been married for 16 years, together 18. 2 wonderful kids and life is good.",2,2
702,551,"I'm 21 years old, and I spend most of my time alone. I feel like I'm only going to start actually living when I leave my parents' house, which I assume I will be 23/24 by then. This year as soon as I finish college I will go back to living with my parents, which will make things even harder since they can be a bit strict, specially when it comes to spending the night out. 

And even now living alone, I don't go out at all because I have no friends here. Also I should mention I never had any partners, never even had my first kiss. Yep - I'm 21. 

Honestly I feel like I'm wasting my life away, and that is the worst feeling ever because life is so rare and it goes by so fast. I feel so lonely, I just cry every night. I feel lost and I don't know what to do. 

Hopefully next year when I find a job and move to a new town things will be better. My only hope is that I'll be able to make friends at work, because I have no idea how to make friends other ways.",3,3
703,553,"It's been a weird couple of months. Recently I began school a few months ago and I was pretty early to my first period on the first day (many seats were open because of this). I heard someone walk in but I didn't pay attention. I saw the chair next to me being pulled out. I glance and meet the eyes of this person who looks so similar to my drawing. It tripped me out so much. I tried to ignore it as well, cool strange coincidence? Right? 

We get to school at similar times and get inside the building at similar times as well. I see them almost everywhere despite only sharing one class with them. One day I didn't enter the building and instead went to the outdoor lunch tables, that day he did the same thing and we saw each other from different directions. We even walk together into class some days because we decide to go in at the same time. We both accidentally chose the same table to sit at. 

Sometimes I'm looking in crowds and we see each other and just stare. Even on the bleachers during assembly I saw them even though I'm not looking for them. 

Last week one of the classroom buildings was shut down (electricity issue) and on the rainy Wednesday when that happened I met them on the other side of the stairs where they happened to go to since the shut down. That day I talked to them. 

We sit in the same row of desks and when I glanced over to him he did the same at me, we were sitting the exact same way with our Chromebooks tilted at the exact same angle (I tilted mine so my classmates behind me would not look at my Chromebook for answers). We both shared confused looks and switched up our positions. Isn't that so weird?",2,2

This girl studies the same as me and we are enrolled in almost all classes together, that wasn't planned, it just happened to be that way. Because of this, I've seen her daily and have spent a lot of time with her, doing school things and other things as friends. 

I started to catch feelings for her. I have received signs that the feeling is both ways. This is where my Dilemma starts, I don't know what to do. 

The exchange semester has been a priority since I decided it was what I wanted to do after the pandemic, but I really have started falling for her. 

As of having a distant relationship we are on the same page, we have talked about it, not about us being together per se, but how would each one proceed in each case. 

And we also agree, that four months, that is the time left for me to go, would be a little too tight for something good to develop, although we would see each other daily and for quite some time.",2,2
705,56,"My aunt called me a few weeks ago and wanted me to go with her on a road trip. It was kind of unexpected, but I haven't seen her much in the last few years so I was excited. We were headed to a wedding about 6 hours away. I didn't really know the guy getting married, but I had met his mom a few times. 

On the way to the wedding, we stopped to visit several relatives. Again, people I hadn't seen in years. It was so fun to catch up with all my cousins! We had a blast at the wedding, or rather, the wedding reception and dance! Now that was a good time. Everyone was out on the dance floor and most of them were very good dancers. My aunt and I didn't participate in that, but it sure was fun watching everybody out there. The food was good too! 

After the dance, we headed back to another friend's house to spend the night. I had met him a few times before, and we spent a couple of enjoyable days with him. We spent a few more days visiting with more friends and relatives before we headed back. 

I absolutely had a blast. We talked all the way there and back which was about a 12 hour round trip. This is my favorite aunt of all time, and I'm so glad she asked me to go with her. She is over 70 now, and doesn't get around as well as she used to, so I soaked in every moment of our time together. 

I only wish it could've lasted longer, but unfortunately, I had to get back to work. I hope we get the opportunity to do another road trip together!",2,2
706,560,"I struggle viewing myself as a person in myself and I look towards other people. In a lifetime, we hear a numerous amount of things and we receive and process all of that info. I took all of this info and I have found a pattern of the things people tend to dislike and judge of me and what people tend to like. 

People tend to tell me, in criticism that I am annoying. I am overzealous and overwhelming. I talk too much. I am strange or boring. My interests aren't interesting or I go about them in a way that isnt. I am pretentious. I speak in a condescending or rude or too wordy way. I am inappropriate. I say wrong things at wrong times. I overshare. I am confusing. I speak grandly and without direction and it's impossible to speak with me. 

People tend to tell me, in a positive tone that I am comfortable. I make them feel safe and comfortable to be themselves. I am nonjudgmental. Good presence. I am knowledgeable. I know an abundance of things and never run out of things. I am imaginative and have a way with words. I am witty. I have good taste. I am sweet. 

It puts me into perspective. I feel less completely awful or completely godly. Seeing both sides makes me feel human, which is the goal for now.",3,3
707,561,"I'm so happy, but I barely have anyone to share it with who would even really notice. I feel like I'm working really hard towards something, but I'm the only one who sees it. It's been a lot of ups and downs, I swear, I lose and gain weight just by the day. But this is the first time that scale has read 210, and I'm so glad! 

I started this whole journey out becuase I was tired of my Doctors telling me that I was in pain becuase I was fat. She yelled at me, when I complained about my high cholesterol medication causing heart palpitations, and told me if I didn't take the med I'd just be destroying my heart. 

Well, I ditched the doctor. Ditched the cholesterol medication (I really don't think heart palpitations are better than high blood pressure) and I got to work. I'm still waiting for a new doctor,but in the meantime I take natural cholesterol reducers and watch what I eat. I always try to leave something on the plate. 

I also started physical therapy. Turns out some of that pain was from an old injury and a herniated disc in my neck. I'm still not done, but it's amazing what a 30 min workout a day has gotten me! 

Here's to the next 15lbs. And to whatever goals you all are working towards!",3,3
708,562,"Maybe it's just a poor people thing, but when I was growing up every one just assumed that if some random kid is at their house, they're gonna be eating. If my stepdad had a bbq and one of my friends rolled up smelling hot dogs he'd give them some food. I remember my mom splitting two cans of speghettios and buttered bread among five random preteens who found each other while biking around the neighborhood, and those five random preteens giving mom some of their help because we knew she was full of it when she said she ""wasn't hungry"" or going to my best friend's house with three bags of ramen because another friend had a can of peas and another had tuna and we all shared our 'casserole' among like five families. 

My stepdad liked to bbq, nothing fancy. hot dogs, hamburgers, If it was a special occasion he'd do ribs and chicken. Mom would make a big thing of potato salad (because we couldn't afford the deli kind and hers was better) and people around the neighborhood would filter in with whatever to share and make a plate. 

Kids would run around the neighborhood catching lightening bugs and 'causing trouble' while the ""cool teenagers"" smoke, drank and made sure the younger kids didn't die. I was always right between the ""younger kids"" and the ""older kids"" so I could go play ""big sister"" then come hang out and be ""little sister"" for a bit. (There weren't very many kids my actual age unless my cousins were over) 

I just love remembering those days. On one hand I never had anything to myself and sometimes it really sucked. My family was ""the safehouse"" where a lot of other families stayed at so it was rare I had my room, tv or toys to myself. But on the other hand it was awesome and I just love closing my eyes and 'taking myself back' for a little while.",2,2
709,568,"Ever since elementary school, people have made comments about my voice asking me to scream, telling me I sound like a man, saying I sound weird, asking me why I sound the way I sound, and telling me I'm saying words incorrectly. All of those experiences made me turn into an introvert and my social skills have gone to 0. 

Anyways! fast-forward to today I went to the clothing store and I got some clothes I wanted to try on, I go to the dressing room and the lady asks what's your name? I say my name and she just has that smirk on her face like someone who wants to laugh at you. I thought at first maybe she had that look because I probably did say it weirdly and I brush it off.

I go back out and I found some new clothes to put on so I head back to the dressing room. She asks me again what's your name? I say my name and again all of a sudden that smirky laughing face comes back on like she wants to laugh at me. It hurt my feelings knowing that I probably sound funny to her.

After that I just stayed quiet cause i was afraid of someone doing the same thing she did to me. I might have overreacted but it hurts because Ive been through the same thing after talking countless of times.",3,3
710,57,"A moment that will stay with me forever was the day I finally met my long lost sister. We were separated at a very young age and I never really knew much about them. I used to ask my parents what was she like and if they knew how and what she was doing. Hearing them talk about her just made me so eager and excited to one day hopefully actually meet her. 

So one day I decided to go ahead and do some digging to try and find her and see if we could speak. Sadly I came up with no results and that was kind of heartbreaking at the time because I just felt that if I couldn't find her then, I would never actually meet up with her. So I felt gutted for that but in a turn of events, I was sent a message from someone she knew. 

I instantly replied and we got something set up. My sister and I had a conversation and it was so amazing for me because I always had so many questions. She answered every question I had and she definitely had questions for me. I was more than happy to answer any and everything she wanted to know about me, because that's my sister. 

So for me this was a great timethough we ended up planning a face to face meeting and we met at the airport. We embraced and had a big long hug and we both cried actually. I was literally shaking because I thought I would never actually see my sister ever and make memories with her while we were older. 

This was a moment for me that I plan on never forgetting until the day I'm no longer around.",3,3
711,573,"In highschool, I got into relationships really young and really invested in them, to the point that I would spend all day with my SO which naturally made me miss out on creating meaningful friendships and having a proper group. Fast forward a few years, we have all now graduated highschool and are pursuing different careers but there is that one group of girls that is super tight and I wish I were a part of that so badly. I went to highschool with these girls and I'm friendly with almost all of them, but I'm not in their group. 

I do have 2 female friends that I'm close to, but even to them I feel like I'm not as important to them as they are to me; but I'm so afraid of losing that little female energy I have around me that I just try to preserve those friendships in whatever way I can. 

I chose to pursue a field where I have to self study and give exams and therefore I didn't join uni either, meaning no opportunity to have a uni group of friends. I will start working in a few months but I've heard work friends aren't really life long friends due to the work relationship. 

I feel like I'm missing out so badly because I never have a group to hangout with and individual hangouts are great but not the same fun. I just feel like such a loser and just anxious and isolated. I avoid social media because seeing groups makes me really anxious and sad. 

I have tried messaging people and planning group hangouts with different people but those hangouts never result in anything and I am simply the person who has to make the next plan and then the next. 

I just have so much regret about my priorities in highschool and wake up everyday wishing I had invested in friendships instead of relationships because I'm just utterly alone now.",3,3
712,582,"A group of my friends picked me up for a night out at a venue around the corner from my house. I walk past this place daily and think nothing in particular about it. However on this particular day I went into the building as my friends wanted to go. I was first in the door and they followed behind me. 

We were in a single file line as when you walk through the entrance there is a staircase that takes you upstairs into a bar. I am first up the stairs and my friends follow behind. As I got to the top step I shook my hands in the air and said nope, I'm not walking into this place (the door to enter the bar was to the right side of me) before I could even see in, I did a U turn at the top of stairs and told my friends that I didn't want to go there. 

They walked back down the steps and I followed them outside. We decided to go somewhere else that evening and had a great night. 

The same group of friends returned back to the original venue 2 weeks later. 2 of them were stabbed and fortunately survived, but my other friend was shot dead inside the venue. 

I often think about this and wanted to share as I don't quite understand why I chose to leave when I did. I didn't foresee anything, I had no visuals, it just felt off to me. I don't know if this is because I noticed and felt uneasy that the only entrance was also the exit, downstairs, though this isn't something I'd typically pay attention to. 

Regardless I hate that my friend lost his life and yet I wonder if I would have witnessed this or lost my own life had I remained there the first time. I cant help to think about this and its meaning.",3,3
713,586,"Recently I started a job alongside a really friendly guy who will pick random topics throughout the day and ask me to tell him interesting things about them. It didn't start out that way but after we became pals it's regular now. To be clear, I only know a few things about most things, and what I know most of all is that I don't know anything. 

This guy though, is not a very bright man. I don't know how to say that more nicely but please trust at this point I'd take a bullet for this dude. Earlier this week he stumped me good. I forgot how it came up but he asked ""Wait isn't America capitalist?"" Me:""...Yeah. Mostly. Yes and no."" Him:""Well I know we aren't communist for sure."" Me: ""I mean that's not entirely true we have some socialist policies."" Him: ""Wait what's socialist?"" 

After I kept failing to give a satisfactory answer his line of questioning boiled down to ""What is communism? Who is communist right now? Why are they bad?"" I briefly tried to think of a way to change the subject but instead I was honest with him. ""That is a famously unanswerable question that nobody I know, especially me, can do any justice to.I admit defeat."" 

He was so happy he stumped me. He mentioned it more times that day. Anyway the point is, this great big golden retriever of a man treats me like an episode of Beat The Geek and I don't think I could adequately explain to him how he is quietly my biggest source of self-esteem maybe ever.",2,2
714,587,"I'm really excited to do the course and experience all the content, but it was such a weird awful day. It feels like everyone is 18 or 19 and just finished their A Levels, I feel so out of place. We had to walk around the campus in groups of 4 or so, and take pictures to make sure we knew where everything was, but I could barely talk to my arbitrary group, we had nothing in common. The rest of the group left me before we properly finished, one with a friend from their old school and the other two just walked away without acknowledging me shortly after, and didn't seem to care if they finished the task or not. 

When we got back to the full class at the end of the day, everyone shared their photos and every other group looked like they had a really good time, spent time on their photos and all that. I really wanted to get some good ones but it felt like my group just wanted to get it done with and do something else. 

I have horrible anxiety and it's taken a lot to even start the course, and I've left the day wishing I didn't have to spend time with people at all. I don't fit in, I'm too old, I've done all the uni stuff before and dropped out so I couldn't feel the same about all the new experiences everyone was having. I feel weird speaking to these people as the peers that they are bc I'm 5 years older. 

I'm excited to study the content but the first day was awful and I don't know how to feel, I'm not going to stop going but a full year of not fitting in because I sat at the wrong table on day one feels like it's looming. I need to get this out and feel like I'm talking to someone but I can't really tell many people in my real life, I just hope it gets better.",3,3
715,59,"In 10th grade I took a cooking course and for a big project we had to cook an appetizer, a meal, and a dessert at home and serve it to our family and take pictures of the food. I made garlic bread, spaghetti, and red velvet cake. I had never made cake before but I wanted to try and I thought I might as well. 

I took a huge piece to school the next day. I told my teacher I made a cake for the dessert portion and offered her to try it, she said ""well I'm not gonna turn down free cake"" so I went to my locker to grab it. She tried it and said it was pretty good but it was a little too soft, which it was just because I had one of those weird funnel cake pans instead of flat ones. 

I think she ended up giving me an extra 5% on my final grade for giving her some cake. I've had a lot of bad experiences with teachers but I still think about that once in a while. 

I made the same recipe yesterday and did 3 layers with homemade cream cheese frosting, I think it's the best one I've made yet.",2,2
716,590,"I'm an intern working at a small company. I get paid a ridiculously unfair amount considering the amount of commuting I'm doing for my job. I've reached the point where I can barely afford to work here any more with gas prices, car maintenance, rent, and prices of school (yeah I have to PAY to work a job through my school) so I've been making financial cuts in some areas where I can, the biggest being food. I have about $20 budgeted for food a week. I can usually make do, eating ramen and cheap frozen meals from Walmart, but my body and mental have definitely taken a toll. 

I had a granola bar for lunch today and watched as my coworkers (who are all paid very handsomely) eat takeout from some fancy restaurant. As they were getting ready to go back to work, I stopped one of my coworkers and quietly asked him if he was going to finish his meal. It was just a bit of rice and half a potato but that food looked so good compared to the burnt microwave lasagna and plastic ramen noodles I've been eating. He didn't say anything, just gave me a weird look and threw the rest of his food in the garbage and walked away. 

I'm sitting here in the break room right now trying to hold back my tears because I don't even know why. I just feel so ashamed that it's come down to this. I dont know if I'm crying because I have to beg my coworkers for their left over food, or the fact that he threw out perfectly good food for no reason, or the fact that no body here knows or cares how much I'm struggling. 

A 20 year old, with a full time job, should not be struggling to eat, to pay rent, to live. I just feel so incredibly helpless, I've had zero financial support from my parents since I moved out but because they do well I get next to no funding from our government for school. I can't ask for a raise because I'm just an intern and should be thankful for this opportunity. 

I just dont know what to do anymore.",3,3
717,598,"I work in a pretty good job for my age, making what I would consider great money for my age (24). I have a new house with a decent amount of property, car, etc. I'm married to my highschool sweetheart; we started dating when I was 15, broke up at 17, then got back together again in college. 

I don't really do anything besides work, exercise, and hangout with my wife/dogs at home pretty much everyday. No other hobbies outside that although my exercise does include 3 different activities currently. I played sports in school, but I most definitely did not use my full potential. I had a football and academic scholarship and all that to play safety at a very prestigious school in my region; but of course I smoked weed in HS and that pretty much explains how motivated I was to exceed at that time (not that weed is bad, I still smoke). 

With all that being said, 90% of the time I am extremely happy with my life and blessed to have the opportunities I do. Now the other 10%..... So basically pretty much everyday (at some point) I think HARD, and I mean very hard, about being back in highschool. Now obviously most of you would jump straight to the fact that I didn't get to play out my sports dreams; yes that's most definitely #1 on the list, but I know that. 

What I don't know is the other stuff I think about. My friends, the girls, my parents, actually being in school. I dream constantly of all those things. It's like I'm going right back to highschool with the same people and I'm making the same decisions all over again. It doesn't make any sense. 

I do love my wife very much but when I have these dreams it's almost as if the world is telling me I made all the wrong choices? The emotional feeling is so strong and it lasts for days sometimes after having a very vivid dream. I feel like my past self is trying to tell me it's not happy with my life now, even though I definitely am in most respects. 

I've talked to my wife fairly openly about it without trying to sound like I hate my current life, because I really don't. I just wish there was a way I could talk to my younger self and see what he wants!!!",3,3
718,609,"I wont go in too much depth but as a kid I never thought I was above average in appearance, not even average looking. Although a constant in my life recently is the topic of crushes or someone liking me. 

I just finished high school and I'm starting to reflect. But for context, primary school was the first time someone had told me a boy had liked me. I thought it was absolutely unfathomable, it's 100% fake and they're antagonising me, trying to gain a reaction. Well it wasn't. This boy innocently stared at me as we passed every day and proposed to me with 2$. Of course that's where it started. 

I started high school and of course romance was everywhere. I couldn't escape it, every male friend I had gained that year liked me. And now I'm not friends with any of them since they didn't view me as a friend. 

I'm not obsessive, I've never dated. But as I grew older I realised I craved male validation. And I know that sounds pathetic but that's just how I am. 

Now if a guy you don't know likes you generally you forget about him and move on. I have a habit of online stalking him, constantly checking if he viewed my story on Instagram, and when I was at school I would fix myself up before passing him in the halls, purposely passing by where he hangs out to see if he would notice me. 

I don't like him. But something in me wants to impress him and make sure he still likes me. I wanted to be brutally honest on here but I don't think I can do it, I can get a lot worse. I don't mean worse as in I physically stalk these guys. It's just strange how worried and stressed I am about impressing guys who have claimed to like me.",3,3
719,61,"I have gone from a happy, vibrant kid to a sad, tired adult. My own mother has said she doesn't even recognize me anymore. ""Where has my ""my name"" gone?"" is something she said this week. 

I blame it on my parents. My family is very close-minded. Often times people in my class in middle school would ask me to go play with them and my parents almost always wouldn't let me. They didn't let me sleep at other people's houses. I had to make up excuses every time but after 2-3 times 'I'm going to the cinema with my brother' doesn't work anymore. The kids didn't invite me anymore and I barely had any friends left. 

In high school things changed a bit. I changed my personality and became a class clown. People laughed at my jokes and I gained lots of friends. However, the same thing as in middle school happened. Friends asked me to go to parties, my parents wouldn't let me and I was cast out.

Now I'm in university and have virtually no friends. The thing that hurt me the most was that people were interested in getting to know me often until I've had to reject their offer to go out every time. 

A recent example was a girl I met about a year ago. When I met her we immediately clicked and talked for days on end but I could never go and meet her because she lived far away and my parents wouldn't allow it. The conversations slowed down and stopped. 

I've had opportunities to get closer to people but every time things are going somewhere it is put to a halt by my restrictive parents. Now I fear that I will never be able to engage in any long term relationship ever. 

I am thinking about my future a lot and all I want is a house, a wife, kids and some good friends. And everyday that scenario is looking less and less plausible in my mind.",3,3
720,611,"I came from a tropical country where it's always summer. Then I moved and lived in Japan. I can't begin to describe how much I love having the other 3 seasons to enjoy! And my favorite has got to be fall. 

I came to Japan late summer, and it was fall that was the first ""new"" season that I got to know. It was magical how the days became so cool, like there was AC turned on everywhere. I can wear thicker clothes and enjoy hot dishes without sweating so much. It was just so comfy, I was so happy I can experience it. 

But since we didn't have this season back home, I didn't know how to spend it. I had to watch Youtube videos, and it's mostly western people with pumpkins and pumpkins, and lots of sweets and spices. Right now, I bought tiny pumpkins to decorate various corners of the house. I plan to get some dried bouquet flowers too, and a lot of candles. 

I don't bake, so I got bottles of aromatic oils that smells like pumpkin pie, caramel cookies, coffee cakes, cinnamon rolls, vanilla frosting, etc. Oh, plus movies and books! I'm going through a lot of fun adventure stories. I plan to marathon the Harry Potter movies.",3,3
721,615,"I live with my parents and I'm trying to study for an exam, so I can get an A+ certification and a better job that pays me enough to live on my own. My problem is that over the past few months I could have made some serious progress in the online IT course I'm studying, yet I'm REALLY good at procrastinating. 

I've been sitting at the halfway point for awhile now, and have had trouble motivating myself to continue. What bothers me the most is that I spend my day goofing off and wasting time, but not in any meaningful way. Reading and playing video games are some of my favorite hobbies, yet during my free time I don't even really do these things anymore. 

I stare at Youtube's home page, watch some videos I don't really care about, and if I'm lucky I'll hop on Steam and play a couple matches of a multiplayer game. If I'm not dispassionately scrolling Youtube or social media, I'm pacing my room waiting for it to be time to head to my overnight job. 

I have HUNDREDS of games across multiple platforms that I've never finished or tried, books I've never read... a work certification that I should really be studying for. But I spend most of my free time waiting to go back to work. My job isn't very challenging and has a good amount of downtime, and I don't even use that time at work to study/read/whatever. 

I keep telling myself ""when I have a day job and my own apartment I'll play more games in my free time"", yet I don't do the studying that will actually get me to that point. I don't know if I'm a little depressed, or just burnt out or what.",3,3
722,618,"This might be a weird thing to be proud of, but for the first time in months I am finally feeling content with my life. This year tested me in many ways -- I moved across the country to LA, then a rough break up in March, and fired in June, from a job I thought I was going to be at for decades. At first, this felt like the end of the world but I quickly realized I needed to make some serious changes to not fall down the path of depression and alcoholism. 

At 20 years old, I have the flexibility to make some impulse decisions, so I called my best friend and asked if she'd like to move to San Diego with me. I won't lie, it took months to feel comfortable here. At points I had under $5 in my bank. But we found a dirt cheap, nice apartment in a good area. We made friends. Already have made the best memories of my life. I never drink alone anymore. 

And, the icing on the cake, I got 3 raises in 3 months and am back to having a comfortable salary. Moving here was the best decision of my life, and it all stemmed from an impulse phone call that I had little intention of following through on.",3,3
723,619,"It's October again and I'm struggling again with my birthday coming up in a week. It feels stupid to feel bad about it and yet here I am. I've always had a lot of issues with my birthday and I very much understand why it causes me distress. But dealing with it has been a disaster year after year for different reasons. As a kid my birthday lands on a local festival; when I was little other kids' parents would much rather attend the festival than let their kids come to my party. It was devastating to have no one show up year after year outside cousins who I didn't know or get along with well. 

In highschool I attended a school an hour away. My friends lived far away and the same thing happened. As an adult my friend group has dwindled. I don't really have any real life friends anymore. I dont organise a party for myself because why bother. I usually just drink at home. I've been living alone since 2018. I just would go under the radar, I wouldn't even talk to my gaming/online friends who have no idea when my birthday is anyway. 

My parents divorced when I was 21 and I'm a lot closer to my mum. She moved in with me after the divorce and has bought a house nearby to be close to me. She understands a bit of my situation and doesn't push it beyond asking if I want to have dinner or see a movie. But my dad doesn't understand. He presses me every year to go down to my home town for dinner. I can't drink because I have to drive the hour home. Honestly I only really go because he usually gives me some cash and money is tight right now. 

I think this year has hit harder because my boyfriend now lives with me. He moved across Australia to be with me and I couldn't be happier. But he is currently having to choose between spending the time with me or going home to visit his sick grandfather. I want him to go but he keeps pressing back and having doubts on leaving. I have no idea if he is doing it because he knows my birthday is hard on me or if he genuinely doesn't want to go.",3,3
724,62,"My dad is not the greatest, but he's not terrible either. When I was little, we were practically joined at the hip. I was spoiled, but I knew my daddy loved me and was so proud of me. As I got older things changed. We fought so much. I started self harm pretty early. Only into my twenties did I get the help to understand that my dad is really mentally ill and that I am too, but that I can be stable with help from therapy and have an ok relationship with dad even though he won't accept help. 

Now the one thing dad and I both love (besides nature and animals) is horror films. He's picky, only really digs the classics he grew up on. He never ever wants to watch any horror films with me. He says his scary movie days are over. 

Well I was talking with him about how I recently watched the blob for the first time, and how I was able to watch the night of the living dead on this new streaming service. We jabbered about freaks and jaws and some other flicks. He saw Godzilla was available and told me a hilarious story about my uncle and him sneaking into the balcony at the movies and uncle knocked his soda off the balcony when Godzilla finally showed up. 

We laughed about dad sneaking uncle and their remaining soda back down into the lower section just as the dude covered in soda alerted the staff. I said I've never seen any Godzilla flicks and today, we're gonna watch the original together. Complete with popcorn and soda!",3,3
725,621,"I'm honestly a huge car nerd and enthusiast. I love having this interest but it's also very alienating, as I struggle to get along with other people who share the ""same"" interest. In my experience nothing attracts annoying, argumentative, misinformed fanboys like the car community. I'm sure there are good ones out there, but they are incredibly rare. 

For example, the standards of ""fun"" that get tossed around. It's believed that a ""fun"" car means having a Fast and Furious car, like some low two-seat track car with 1,300 horsepower, recaro seats and a roll cage. Any other car that doesn't have this is worthless or bad in some way. It's really dumb to me because it shows their only real knowledge of cars doesn't exist beyond what they saw in some movie chocked with CGI. 

Of course they're going to see ""fun"" when they see Vin Diesel driving the car over cliffs and sliding under semi trucks, or when baby driver is pulling insane J-turns at 290 mph after a bank heist. But ""fun"" could be so many other things depending on the person, and the reasons would be every bit as justified. 

To some people, ""fun"" might be driving a big truck with a big engine. Fun could be driving a classic car, or it could be driving a really quiet and smooth car, or it could even involve being higher off the ground. 

Even outside of driving the car, someone might genuinely appreciate their car for it's real-world capability, like its ability to haul, off-road, people-move, road-trip, or other common things that cars are used for. There are so many other purposes for different cars beyond speed and track use that can make them just as enjoyable. 

Those highly revered track cars have so many disadvantages, and even the strengths are hardly usable in the real world. It's honestly just annoying and I have a hard time respecting someone or seeing them as anything other than a misinformed, closed-minded fanboy if they believe the only good and worthwhile cars come from Fast and Furious. There are normal, everyday cars faster than those, and they do it much more comfortably. 

I've had so many arguments with people over this and it's so annoying. People get so political about cars, don't even get me started on the argument between gas vs. electric. I wish I had a different hobby/interest where people were more accepting/welcoming.",2,2
726,622,"I love my husband. We've been together for almost 4 years. Got married this past June 2022, and now expecting our first in March 2023! We've been through so much together. We've gone through stages where we've hated each other. We've lived through the times we felt like we were just roommates. 

But for awhile now, we've been so in love. This is the most magical part of our relationship, where we've seen the worst in each other, accepted it, and are now truly in love with one another. He makes me feel so loved. He loves every part of me and tells me how beautiful I am every single day. Even though I feel like a pregnant whale. He is so excited for our baby girl. He came home with a baby towel shaped like a shark because he knows I love sharks. 

My favorite part of our relationship is, no matter how long or short it's been, we are always so excited to see each other. He is my forever best friend. I will never take back the hell we went through, because we wouldn't have made it here without it. I've never felt so in love before. I can't wait to tell him how much I love him when he comes home from work.",3,3
727,625,"A few months ago I started school again. Every day I take the train to school. Sometimes I shop at the very expensive shop at the station. One time I was gonna buy an ice cream and I wanted a bag of crisps but I didn't have the money so I thought what if I scanned it myself and ""forgot"" to scan the crisps, then I could act shocked if someone caught me. It worked. I found it amusing but I promised myself I wouldn't do it again. 

The next time I shopped there, I did it again. I didn't mean to, it just felt good to. I got addicted to it and I just couldn't stop. I felt worse every single time and at the end of the month I had stolen at least 10 this way. I thought they would catch on to me and I thought about ending it all because I didn't know what else to do. 

Today, I did the same scheme but a security guard was behind me. I sat down to eat and he called me out. I pretended to be shocked and paid. He warned me it would be considered theft and I apologized profoundly. I could thankfully pay for everything this time. But now I'm scared he's on to me. 

I obviously won't steal again. I will do whatever it takes to assure that. But what if he finds out I stole more? I can't go to jail, I'm only 19! I just feel sick to my stomach and I can't stop crying because I feel so bad. I would go straight to the police if I wasn't so scared of jail. I wanna tell someone but I'm scared.",3,3
728,626,"My dad left me and my mom after 14 years. At first it was a really hard hit because I didn't want my family to break apart but no matter what I could do it wouldn't change what's going to happen. It was difficult. 

Shortly after my parents broke up (they never married) my dad had to find a place to live so he was still with us for a bit. Eventually he moved out and even though he said he's still my dad and we're still a family he never visited. He never called. He barely texts. He never came over for supper. None of it. We tried to be understanding because not even a few days after my parents broke up my dad's nephew passed away due to drugs and my dad practically raised him so it was like his son just passed away. 

We gave him the space he needed but also reminded him he wasn't alone. Turns out he wasn't even alone in the first place. Barely two weeks after they broke up he found another woman and has been with her in secret until we found out randomly through Facebook. My mom was furious because he lied to us. He could've told us but he deceived us. 

Then my mom told me that the woman he's with used to be a drug dealer. My mom's been with my dad for 14 years and knows him so well. She said that in the photos of him and that woman he looks intoxicated and even my auntie agreed. So my dad is doing drugs and ignoring me and my mom. 

This whole situation is messy and both me and my mom realized how abusive he was since he left and it's left me in quite the shock. I admired my dad so much but now I don't even know if I want him to be my dad anymore. It makes me feel worthless like all those times he was being my dad he didn't even care about me.",3,3
729,629,"I'm recently out of a relationship. As in, we broke up about a month ago. As I've been coming to terms with that and trying to move on, I've caught myself starting to have stronger feelings towards one of my best friends, and I wish they would just go away. 

He's a great dude, honestly. I feel like in the off chance that we did end up together that it'd be a perfectly fine relationship. It's not him that makes me hate that I've developed these feelings. 

I hate that I'm feeling these things before I'm even fully over the last relationship. I hate that my past relationships that were not great took nearly half a year before I was ready to move on, but with the one that was the best experience I've ever had in the dating scene I've developed new feelings only a month out of the gate. 

I hate that I'm either going to sit here and wait until it's too late to reveal my feelings, or I'm gonna man up and tell him how I feel only to put an awkward bar in a really good friendship and mess that up for me, if not for both of us. 

I don't know how to feel, honestly.",3,3
730,63,"Today was the last of my 3 root canal appointments. When I went into the office on that first appointment, I was crying and shaking and just wanted to run away. I felt nothing though, the tooth was already dead and the local anesthesia she gave me was amazing. So I gained some confidence. 

The second appointment I was still nervous, but not crying anymore. Today was the third one and I went there smiling. Right now I feel some pressure from the root canal filling but apart from that I feel great. Proud, mostly. 

Even when I was left alone in that room with all the spooky instruments, I wasn't scared or even nervous. And after my appointment I went and bought some groceries. My past self would've went home and wouldn't have left the bed, trying to cope with the intense anxiety that had built up within me. 

But not today. And I already made some new appointments for next year to fix the rest of my dental problems. I'm kinda excited about them. I never had super pretty teeth before, so I'm excited to see how my smile will look when it's all done. 

All because of my amazing dentist who is so calm and just such a warm, caring person.",3,3
731,631,"I've always been depressed. Because of a multitude of things (family abuses, expectations, school stresses, SAs, unhappy childhood), and I don't know exactly why now, I'm suffering from all sorts of emotional pain. It's like being overly sensitive to every single thing; I split, have trouble controlling my emotions, especially anger. 

It affects my relationships with friends and potential significant others. It affects my performance in school. It affects my decision making skills. 

I finally snapped. I tried to overdose last week but didn't succeed. Out of concern, the doctors there transferred me to a mental health hospital where I'm forced to stay for 3 weeks or less. Here I was diagnosed with BPD and severe depression. 

I truthfully want to improve myself and to get out of these horrible headspaces. I tried everything: walk-in clinic, meds, psychologist, psychiatrist. But so far it hasn't worked. 

I want to become normal again. I want to be happy for the sake of my friends who have taken so much of their time to help me. I want to apologize to each single one of them for all the trouble I have caused, and make amends to the things I've said just now because I got frustrated.",3,3
732,632,"My boyfriend of over 2 years broke up with me a few weeks ago. I won't get into it, but he is in a bad situation that is preventing us from really being together. I would do anything for him, and anything to be with him. He has decided that he doesn't want to hold me hostage, preventing me from meeting someone else that can love me the way I deserve. 

There was nothing I could say or do to get him to change his mind. I'm very hurt and feel dead inside. I feel really safe with him, and this is the first healthy relationship I have ever been in. He has inspired me to be the successful person I am today. I have been working as much as possible because that's what I do when I need to go numb. 

We are still friends, hanging out, hooking up. Almost like we are still together, but we are not. I'm confused. We love each other very much, but we aren't together anymore. I worry that he is going to start hooking up with other people. He has been working out, which he would never do while we were together or with me. 

I'm turning 40 this year. I just don't know if I can meet someone else. Im single, have no kids, and no one has ever wanted to be with me that isn't using me besides my ex. I just can't believe I'm not his girlfriend anymore.",3,3
733,633,"Had an intense, wonderful two and half month relationship end when he realized he wasn't in a place for a serious relationship. He said he was ready when we first met. It hurts like hell. We hit it off so well and had a lot in common and were often on the same page without even having to say it. He treated me better than anyone else I've ever been with. 

I'd been alone and career focused for the last 10 years and had been in an emotionally abusive situationship earlier this year. He looked me in the eyes and told me how good he felt about me and us and how good I made him feel and how he wasn't going anywhere. He said we'd get through this bump in the road. 

A month or so in, when he knew that I was looking for a pet, the vet clinic he works at got a kitten in off the streets. He named it after me and gave her to me saying she is the physical representation of the piece of his heart he's giving to me. Of course now I have to think about that whenever I see her.I feel bad but I may just temporarily rehouse her. 

I did everything I could to support him while he worked 80+ hours a week. Not everything was perfect and I maybe should have read the writing on the wall. He tended to speak impulsively and had a bit of an ego that he seemed to be proud of. He valued work more than anything and had issues with authority. I attributed it to just him being a guy. Ambition is great but obviously you have to make sacrifices to make that happen. 

He spoke a little too graphically about his exes. I'm so tired of being alone. And how can someone look into your eyes and say all these things and then say they don't want a relationship? I'm 36 years old and tired of not having a shoulder to lean on. I just want to hold hands and cuddle. 

I brought down so many of my walls for him. I was more vulnerable with him than anyone else. He left the door cracked since his situation could change in a few months. But given how he spoke to me before and what has happened how can I trust him? 

He said he really wanted me to be his friend. I told him I always was. But I get the feeling that he wants the emotional support without having to worry about reciprocation. 

I'm lost and alone and want it to end.",3,3
734,635,"After leaving an abusive workplace where I had no life and no room for development at the beginning of the year, I left and started a new job. It's been fantastic to work at this amazing place that feels like somewhere I can grow. Everything seems amazing and I'm getting great feedback. I have a job I can have a life around again, and my social life blossoms. 

Today, I got dumped after a couple of months of dating this girl. Her reasoning being that she doesn't want to hurt me and her mental health is preventing her from growing and wants to work on herself. Understandable and fair, I get it and have been in her shoes. 

I get called into a meeting with my manager. She tells me that my colleagues don't like my attitude and state I'm difficult to work with. I've really pushed myself at this new job, and tried to grow. Giving 110% wherever I can and picking up extra shifts just to get as much experience as possible. I try to be friendly with all my colleagues, and when things get busy (i work in hospitality) I'm all action, and try to delegate and stay on it as best I can. 

In my meeting my manager told me, my coworkers feel like I overstep the mark and act like the boss (even when fellow supervisors say they want me to take the reins and for me to lead). I'm told I'm scary to some staff, even when I'm always trying to be friendly and helpful to others. All around I'm told that I'm not getting a promotion because my work attitude is wrong. I apparently treat staff like cattle, and I'm near enough told I should quit. 

This all happened over a 3 day period where I was pulling an 11 hour closing shift, into an early morning opening shift. And all I can think of is covering more shifts to try and improve my performance and prove myself more. Stack this with me having car trouble andI feel like my life is spiralling out of control out of nowhere.",3,3
735,636,"I am dating another guy. I'm trans, but he didn't know that before we started dating, and he was absolutely chill with it, so it wasn't a big deal or anything. No medical changes as of now, but I pass decently as I look fairly androgynous. 

But the fact that he fully acknowledges me as a guy is just so affirming. It makes me really happy when I think about it. I'm really grateful to have him. 

But today I heard that he corrected someone when they were talking about me and him! Apparently one of his friends said that they saw him and his ""girlfriend"" together. A mutual friend of ours who I've known longer than since I've known him then said, ""Are you gonna let that slide?"" And my partner was like, ""Oh, it's a dude."" in a relatively nonchalant manner. 

I'm so thankful to have him. The little things that show me that he loves me for who I really am and not just what others perceive just warm my heart a lot. He sees me fully as a guy, and while I acknowledge it might be the bare minimum, I'm incredibly appreciative of him and the fact that I have that.",3,3
736,637,"When covid first hit I had to move from my city to my home town. Wasn't a huge deal as it was for others. It was a year and a half and a lot happened and eventually I came back to my original town, new fiance and cat in tow. I couldn't find a job once I came back and when I did that place got shut down. My fiance did have one, but any paycheck he had didn't go to our shared place, mostly his phone bill or groceries once in a while, while he stayed out till 2 am drinking. So I started. Excessively. 

I don't know now how I did, it was only a few months ago, how I managed to. I borrowed from family or friends, I took out loans to make sure rent was paid. It got so bad I was hospitalized for two weeks because for over a day I was throwing up every hour. I had torn my esophagus. No food. My fiance didn't visit, saying he was scared, but his aunt visited. I cried every night. 

When I got home he was working, he came back and was clearly drinking. The next day my mother texted me telling me she was disappointed in me drinking so much I got myself in that situation. I saw that and realized when I was in the hospital, alone, afraid, and not wanting to live like this. Thus me and my mother didn't speak for months. 

Family stuff happened, got back in touch. We both never apologized but there's a whole lot of cans there to be opened. I ruined relationships I can't take back. Lost contact with friends. 

After this stint my anxiety has been on high alert, making it hard for me to eat or even drink water. Public transit has been scary as I do have those impulse ""what if I ran on the track"" thoughts which I know are ridiculous. 

Thankfully now I do have a job I enjoy, I have my cat, my own place I pay rent.",3,3
737,638,"This may sound unbelievably stupid, but I hate going home from school. I come home to my mum being in a bad mood and shouting every single day. I would be sitting down studying and she barges into the room calling me stupid and useless and how I don't do anything to help and leave her with all the stress and then forces me to get up and clean the house. All while still shouting that I'm useless. 

Not only me, my siblings have to go through this as well. My brother having just started school is obviously still learning the basics and doesn't understand everything. It hurts me when I hear my mum shouting at him and screaming that shes going to kill him if he doesn't get the answer right. But he still gets golden treatment from her when shes in a good mood. 

When I was his age I wasn't allowed to do anything remotely fun. I had to sit down and do exactly as she asked no matter what it was, and go through every one of her punishments. She hits us but I don't think its to the point of physical abuse, but I wouldn't know. 

Even now at 14 I'm not allowed to see my friends outside of school and have to spend any free time studying or helping her cope with stress. I love being at school because at least my teachers don't hurt me when I say something wrong, they help me. 

My mum shouts at me that I'm useless and stupid and I'm going to get nowhere in life. This sounds horrible but I hate her. I hate her so much that I can't wait until I'm 18 so I can leave this stupid home and go no contact with everyone in my family. Because all they do is make me feel like I'm worthless and just someone to do everything they ask.",3,3
738,639,"I have a horrible case of confirmation bias going on, and what's worse is that it's based on nothing. I have a crush on a guy in my class who has a girlfriend. I haven't had a crush in years so I didn't even want to accept what it was at first, but he has been on my mind all week and I hated it. 

I didn't go in today and I turned my phone off to do some work at home and before I turned my phone back on I said it would be funny if he had messaged me. To my complete and utter surprise, he had wanted to know where I was. 

I thought he was trying to distance himself from me because the last time I saw him, it kinda looked like he was avoiding me so I didn't understand. Especially since the first day we met, he invited me to his for a night out as we live close. This was all in front of his girlfriend so it wasn't flirty or anything. 

I'm not going to try anything, and that rational part in my brain is very strong and knows this is just a fantasy which cannot, and will not, go any further. It's just funny because I was begging God to help me find someone a few days before class and there he was. And it was apparent from the instant I saw him which is also rare.",3,3
739,640,"My best friend and I have been friends for a little over year and we really bonded. I honestly wish I met her sooner. We met by her joining the cross country team and we really bonded by having the same interest. We also do track. Towards the end of track season she started to become very distant from everyone and I knew something was up. It took me around 2 weeks to get ahold of her. She told me over the last months where she was being distant she ended up not eating and developed an eating disorder. 

I was scared. I didn't know how to deal with this. It kept on getting worse and worse but my real concern was how her parents where treating her. When I first met them I thought they were nice until this happened. She would say that her parents were refusing to take her to doctor appointments because this whole thing was her fault. Her parents would also refuse to buy healthy food, and when her mom did buy healthy food she would eat it all in front of her or throw it away and force her to only eat desserts. 

She's doing a lot better now but her parents aren't treating her any better. She is having huge mental health issues. Her dad even went physical with her at one point and grabbed her by her neck. On top of that she is having very bad grades at the moment obviously because of all the stuff she's been through. Since she is having bad grades her parents are planning on kicking her out when she turns 18. They took away all of her stuff and the only thing she has in her room now is just a bed. 

This keeps on getting worse and really brought me down. I want to end her suffering.",3,3
740,642,"I have nothing against male friends, the majority of my friends are guys but I try not to make male best friends. Very close emotional attachments with guys can get weird. But we were in grad school with too much in common. We had known each other for forever. We had the same background and our views on the world and life were completely different than other peoples around us. Sort of just became really good friends like it was kind of meant to be. 

 

I could talk to him about anything. The world, politics, economy, life. We could discuss stupid jokes and life responsibilities that others didn't understand. Grad school was all consuming and he quickly became the first person I'd think of when something happened. And I think I was that person for him. He was also excited in my smallest wins. I was so grateful for him, I loved him as a friend. 

 

But, at some point, somehow he kinda flipped on me. I don't know why. He's friendly but he's not the same. He hangs out with a different crowd a lot. We can't talk about random things for hours. He takes hours to respond and sometimes doesn't respond at all the first time I text him. He doesn't send me jokes and pictures of random things. I think I am somewhere the 4/5th person he thinks of when something happens. And sometimes, I'm not even getting news directly from him. 

 

It's upsetting and I actually kind of hate that he's still friendly. What's frustrating is if he were a girl I would've pulled him aside and asked what this is about. We've been so close for quite a while, whats going on? But I can't do that. Not without appearing needy or like I love him or something. I can't text him a bajillion times. I can't ask him why he hangs with a different crowd. I can't joke about why he's being weird without it being awkward. 

 

But I just miss my best friend. He's still the first person I think of when I'm excited, he's still the first person I want to text. I just can't now knowing that I might not even get a reply. Whatever happens, he's still one of the best people I've ever met.",3,3
741,643,"It has been a while since high school, when i first met her. Her soul was vibrant, and it was invigorating each second I looked at her. I noticed her sitting alone every day at lunch and I mustered up the courage to come talk to her. She was so sweet and pure. Nothing could ever dull out her smile. 

Time had passed and we became friends, and I became friends with her friends. We all sat at the lunch tables and those were some of my happiest times. I couldn't help but falling in love with her, but we could never be. She had a boyfriend and at face value I wanted to respect that, but I never could truly understand. 

I told her how I felt but she as uncertain. We still were friends after but my feelings for her were like weights. Her boyfriend found out and just like that we never talked out of school again. Understandably I knew why, but I grew so angry. Was I always so disposable? I kept asking myself. 

I had gotten revenge on her boyfriend, but at what cost? On one side, it felt like I had gotten justice for the empty space in my heart. On the other side, it was for certain that anything I thought we had was burnt in flames. The irony was what I did only brought them closer together. 

Years have passed and every night I think about her. There is no anger, or love left. My life has moved on but my soul seems forever damned. I know I will never see her again, and she will never forgive me. Nonetheless I need to go on and start living.",3,3
742,644,"Thanks to him, there will always be a piece of me missing. His job was to teach math, yet he decided religion should be taught first. Laughing in our faces as he told us how we were all worthless bags of flesh and deserved to burn forever. Along with our parents. Gleefully, joyfully. A class full of minors. 

As someone who was never directly exposed to religion, it hit me. Hard. Have you ever felt true fear? I mean complete and utter hopelessness. Were you in so much fear that you beg to any god out there to spare your mother and take you instead? 

Now imagine the never ending pain. The dread to the point of being sick, the constant torture, the OCD you develop, the suicidal thoughts that NEVER shut up. Being tortured by your own mind. 

And him? He got a slap on the wrist just to exclaim weeks later that he would never force his religion on anyone. As if he didn't bring it up out of nowhere before. Laughing, laughing, so happy as he told us what was going to happen to everyone we loved. 

Even today, I wont forget his laugh. His literal cackling as he paced around with joy. But I'm no longer the same. I used to be curious and asked all the big questions about the universe. Now? That part of me is dead and actively avoids it out of fear. There will always be a deep part of me that flinches when I see a cross or pass by a church. 

The pain of having to fear for your parents' eternal misery. The obsession, the inability to think, the torture, the mental mind games. Even though it's been three years, I will never forget it. For eighteen months, I was in SO MUCH pain. It NEVER stopped. I didn't cope. I lost all motivation and became a shell. 

I don't wish him any harm. I don't want revenge. But I wish he knew that what he did only ensured that I would never be truly able to relax in that religion. That there will always be a remnant of pain and fear. That I am not the same person, that the curiosity that fueled my childhood into the mysteries of the universe is killed. I hate that he could do this when he was supposed to be teaching math.",3,3
743,645,"I always thought I was smart enough to avoid scammers. I never answer unknown numbers or click on links in messages. But recently I posted an ad to sell my motorbike and I was contacted by someone wanting to buy it. They seemed normal at first, asking about the condition and haggling on price. When I offered to view the bike they declined and said they were out of town and were buying it for their son. This should have been a red flag but I completely missed it in my excitement of the sale. 

They asked for my details to organise a courier and said they will pay pal me the money. I soon received emails from the buyer and fake pay pal showing the money had been transferred along with extra to pay for the courier. They apparently didn't have online banking and asked me to transfer the money to the courier. Giant red flag but in my excitement and stupidity I transferred the money. 

It was only 5 minutes later I realised this was fishy and that I had been scammed. I contacted my bank to see if they can cancel the transaction. They will try but seemed pessimistic about getting my money back. Thankfully it was not a large sum of money and it's mostly the shame that is hurting me. 

I am trying to think of this as a costly lesson to never sell anything unless I meet the buyer in person.",2,2
744,646,"I have a friend group of 4 people. Well call them A, B, C, D. We've been super close and have done everything together for a year now. 

A got mad at me for no reason, and B and C are their best friends. I haven't been hanging out with A, B, and C much because of this and I dont really hang out with B or C without A present. 

I'm very close with D, and recently the friend group has kind of split to A, B, C being a trio and me and D being kind of the outcasts I suppose. We never hang out anymore, and I don't know why. 

My breaking point was today. B is getting an award this coming week, and A and C are planning on going to the award ceremony or whatever it is. I said that I could go as well because I didnt have to work anymore, and no one cared. I don't think they even want me to come anymore. 

I don't know why I've been outcasted so suddenly. I dread seeing them every day. I wish it could go back to how it was. Theyre the only friends I have, it's not as simple as get new friends or distance yourself and focus on other friendships.",2,2
745,647,"I am so sick of hearing these people who get on social media and constantly complaining about how ""women withhold sex"". This one guy in particular said women having more sex in the beginning of the relationship then slowing down is ""women trapping men"". This is normal in healthy relationships. Sex slows down for multiple reasons. Hormones being one of those reasons. Women literally have a 28-32day cycle and not being on your period does not mean your cycle is over. 

What about the negative feelings that come with this? The feeling of being used or how it could hurt because you are not aroused. Basically telling women that the man they are in a relationship with is a beast that can't be turned down. 

Dating someone and then finding out they view sex as something you owe them, not an intimate thing you guys enjoy together. Or even accidentally marrying that person and finding out is so sick. I wish I can erase my brain of this misogynistic thoughts. This literally ruins the sex, the fun, the intimacy, and any joy in it. 

Relationships aren't even worth it anymore when you could go through a dry for hormonal reasons or even life getting in the way and find out your partner views you as someone who OWES them sex.",3,3
746,648,"My cousin/bestfriend is getting married soon. I'm happy for her, honestly. After a bad relationship and being hurt in the past, I'm honestly happy she found a man who cherished her so much. But I can't help but feel I'm losing her too. She is my best friend, confidant, and a rock I've had since childhood. 

We used to hang out every weekend or other weekend before the pandemic, we text a lot both updates on life and some creative writings as we both like making stories. But I know with this new chapter of her life, things will change. And I'm afraid of that change. 

I admit, I was and maybe still am quite envious of her. Being younger and having someone to love compared to me who hasn't found one yet. I feel stuck. My younger cousin is getting married while I'm still single and in a limbo. I'm just really at a loss. 

I would do the best I can to support her as she steps into this new chapter of life but I wonder how I can fill this hole in me that's growing as the day looms over that nothing will be ever the same again.",3,3
747,649,"I'm an otherwise regular girl, I am kind and compassionate, I have a long term partner and friends and family I adore. However I can't get over a thought/idea I had as a 14 year old girl that haunts me to this day. I remembered what I thought in my late teens and have been feeling so awful about myself since. 

When I was 14 my parents suggested I look after my baby cousin so my aunt and uncle could have a night out. It never ended up happening, but I remember thinking that if I babysat I could experiment and try putting my cousin's thing in my bottom to see what it felt like. I really do not think I would have actually done this given the opportunity, but I do just feel so ashamed for even thinking such a thing. Like what on earth was wrong with me back then to think that? It's not a normal thing for a 14 year old to think. 

My parents never had conversations with me about sex or consent growing up, and I was dealing with a lot of trauma at the time (family breakdown, emotional abuse). But I still feel like I was old enough to know better and I have no idea why that seemed like an okay thing to do. 

I feel like I'm sick and perverted for ever thinking that, even though I would never think or do that now. I have no attraction to kids and never have. I just hate myself and don't know how to move on from this when everyone I love would hate me if they knew the thoughts/intentions I had back then.",3,3
748,652,"I have been friends with my best friend for almost five years now. To say we're almost polar opposites is an understatement. He's so kind and understanding and he thinks with logic. But on the other hand I don't give second chances or forgiveness and think with emotions backed by logic. 

I've had on and off feelings for him for a while now and I wouldn't have described it as anything but a crush until the last time I saw him. It's just hard and I probably sound like a terrible person, but after every relationship I start to feel for him again. I've always been very open about it with him and distance myself so that I don't make things awkward and he's always been understanding of that. He knows everything about me. 

After my most recent relationship I stayed at his house which is a few towns over and I plan on moving there. We slept in the same bed and he held me the entire night, and everytime I tossed around enough to wake him up too, he'd kiss my shoulder and tell me that he loves me. And we've always told each other that but I've never meant it in that depth until then. He woke me up in the morning before he left for work with coffee and kissed me on the forehead before he left. 

It's just so confusing. I wish I could just flat out tell him when he gets back from traveling but I don't know how. We're going to dinner, which was my idea, but I don't know if I should tell him then.",3,3
749,653,"I've always thought that once I improve my physical looks and style that I will automatically get more friends and romantic interests and while that is sort of true, it didn't happen to the same intensity that I hoped. Like I will get complimented (which I'm really grateful for) but that is the end of the conversation. I don't know how to progress further socially and express myself outside of my 2-3 close friends. Most initiations of conversation from my part are really awkward. 

I've always felt left out and isolated from friend groups despite already being a part of some because I know that my presence doesn't actually matter to anyone. When I go to class everyday I always see groups of people making jokes and having fun and even if I tried to talk to them they seem like such a closed group. 

It is a once in a blue moon experience when I can actually have an easy flowing conversation with someone. I have been working on my body posture and saying affirmations to help with ,y mindset but it kills me knowing that there are people out there who are naturally charismatic and social and don't have to put in the extra effort I do. 

I will have no fun stories to tell when I'm older because I've spent so much of my youth being insecure. I am a senior in high school and have never been to an actual party and it gives me anxiety thinking that I am missing out on experiences that I really want. 

I wish I could go back to when I was a child and was always happy/outgoing but that part of me is long gone and dead.",3,3
750,656,"We'd been friends since year 9 and stayed friends up until last year when we decided to date, the year we finished school. We ended on what I think is good terms as we broke up mutually over the phone agreeing that we have a reoccurring issue we argue over that we don't think we have the maturity to solve but I'm absolutely broken. 

As I've left school, I don't have many friends and my boyfriend was the main person I talk to everyday. We'd only been dating for nearly a year and a half but it still hurts so much. He was my everything. He still is. I gave my virginity to him. 

He ended up moving an hour and a half away during our relationship and I wish I could've got one last hug. He wanted to stay friends and keep talking but I unfriended him as I think we will just get back together if we talk. 

I want to as well but I'm heartbroken and I know I'll never get over it if we keep talking. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up. I don't want to move on but we both know it's best as he's not mentally well either. 

I'm so lost and hurt and I can't stop crying.",3,3
751,657,"My mother failed at raising me. She hasn't done any valuable thing on life but married someone who have some common interests but nothing more. She is dependent to him because of money that's all. Almost every day I hear them fighting mostly on many stupid things. So a lot of times I would just wake up or sleep with them shouting and screaming. 

Besides the messed up family I have, I'd have to go to school everyday with anxiety, fear and sadness. I've had social anxiety for years which fortunately has gotten better elsewhere but school. I dropped out of it last year. Can't say that I was happy but my anxiety went away. Out of fear of my mom and the stereotype that without a school you can't go anywhere I decided to go back one last year and finish it. 

I'm extremely unmotivated so my day goes 7 hours in school and the rest preparing for tomorrow's stress. The reason my mother has failed at raising me is because she has fed fear on me, my father couldn't care less about me so it's almost as if i were raised without a father. She would always tell me don't do that, don't go there, it's dangerous. Or when I was a little kid and was terrified by something like the end of the world, she and her relatives would make up stories about the world ending and everyone dying and they would laugh as I was terrified and crying. They found it funny. 

When I do open up to her most of the time we end up fighting and arguing because she cannot accept that she is wrong in any way. I had told her multiple times to find me a psychologist which she says that she'd take me there but never does, blames it on the work she has and how busy she is. Now I cannot deny the fact that my mother has given me freedom because I don't want to make her seem like a monster parent but rather an ignorant one who failed at parenting. Even though she pushes me sometimes on getting a job I think I have to heal myself first.",3,3
752,66,"I was in South Florida and I was trying to figure out, do I take the path that a lot of my fellow Columbia immigrants at the time took? Maybe stayed home with parents, go to community college and kind of hang around the Colombian-American community. Or I had the choice to explore and see something totally different. 

So I got into college and I didn't know really what I wanted to do. The journey became what thing can I put my heart and soul into for the next 30 years. I went scuba diving in Australia. 

Talking to the captain of the ship, he said, ""I was in a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, and I saw the ocean for the first time, and I was completely sold."" The ocean was that thing that called him that he loved to do and knew that he wanted to do for the rest of my life. And I was like, I need to find that, I need to find my ocean. 

For me, business started becoming that. Looking backwards I had started eight businesses before I got to college. So at Emplify, our goal, our vision is to help improve the lives of 1 million people through more meaningful work. 

Our data will show them how this team is sick in terms of engagement and really their heart and mind not being into their work. And then, we show them something, they do something about it, leadership changes something, and then the work lives of employees are better.",2,2
753,660,"When I was 4 or 5 years old, I visited our neighbor uncle. When I was about to leave, I walked in front of his sleeping dog and thought about touching it because it was cute. But it bit me and I was crying and ran home as fast as I can. I showed my hand to my mom. She was about to slap me but she didn't. I don't remember if I got an injection or not, all I remember is that I was crying and my mom was looking very angry and about to beat me. I still hate dogs because of that day. 

Our family members used to give food to a stray dog. It was a coward and never defended itself when someone threw stones at it or kicked it. So I also started to bully it and throw stones at it everyday after coming to home after school. There were younger kids who also joined me and we bullied it together. It never tried to fight back or bark or bite us. After two or three years, I stopped bullying it. 

Today was a special occasion and our whole family gathered for meal. After that, I was watching Interstellar in my room. The annoying cousin came in and started using tik tok. It was super annoying and I told her to close her phone or lower the volume but she didn't do it so I shouted at her. She said that she'll complain to her parents. I swear if her parents were not in house, I would have beat her very hard. I didn't say anything and watched the rest of the movie. It was really good but half of it was destroyed because of my stupid cousin. My older cousins are nice but she is like a brat. 

So I went out and saw that stray dog. I was angry so I hurt it just like before. It also squealed just like before and I also felt relief just like before. Every thing was the same nothing changed even after a decade.",3,3
754,661,"It's been a year since my last relationship and it ended awfully. Since then I just focused on my goals and achievements. I became a firefighter finally after 3 years. I never really got interest in dating nor love until this weekend. 

I met this girl on Tinder and I thought it was whatever. I shot a crappy pick up line and she found it funny and liked it. We talked on social media on the same night and she invited me over to her house and we were talking and sharing interests. We couldn't stop staring at each other for some reason, but I felt like I was in love. 

We ended up doing it and she kicked me out shortly after because she was expecting family in the morning. I understood and went home. 

I texted her good morning the day after, and she replied with the same line but with a smiley face and heart. Small text conversation and left me on opened. I asked if her day is going well, and still left on opened. 

I couldn't stop thinking about her for the next day and currently, not even with my hobbies that distract me. I haven't really felt like this in a long time, which is why I'm a little shook. 

I don't know what to do, but I can't wait to go back to my shift soon and just keep going.",2,2
755,663,"I graduated college almost 2 years ago with a degree in graphic design. I love what I do and I never have doubted the industry I chose to go into. Over the last few months, however, I've realized that I just hate doing this every day and I have no desire to keep doing this every day for the next forty years. I thought it was just burnout from the current circumstances in the world. 

My girlfriend and I have taken plenty of vacation time, just trying to reset and clear our minds, but within a couple days I just need another vacation. I just started a new job in March and 90% of the time, I like my work and my co-workers, so it's not like I just need a new job. I don't think that will help anything. I'll just start feeling burnt out again in a few months. 

I just genuinely think I'm not supposed to be working every day. I want to travel, camp, see the world, but I don't have the privilege of the money or the time to do that. I've tried to get into freelance work so that I would be at the liberty of my own schedule, but I just don't have the connections to make it a fruitful career option for me. 

Now that I've realized all of this, I have no clue what to do with it. I think about it a lot, and it makes me anxious knowing I can't do anything to correct it. Until I can, I guess I'll just keep going to work everyday.",2,2
756,664,"I am very bad at handling adversity. A slight mishap and my mind goes haywire. The effect is exaggerated when something happens between me and people I care about. I broke up with my Ex a while ago and it's been miserable since. I can't take her out of my head. Even when I'm busy doing something, thoughts of her creep into my mind. It's like I can't even think of anything else. While driving, while eating, while talking with people, I just can't get her picture out of my head. 

I haven't been enjoying my job as well. I don't find any meaning in what I do. The chances that I'll have to work for the rest of my life for 5 days a week got me really anxious. I feel suffocated. Burdened. Unhappy. To escape all this madness within my mind, I've come to live with my friends for a while. 

Away from home, I thought my friends being around will help me distract my mind. It did not help. I feel unwanted. I feel miserable around them and the thought that I'm probably ruining their time as well makes me more miserable. I wanted to cry yesterday, but couldn't. We were having dinner, everyone talking and laughing and I just couldn't even smile. 

I wish I did not have these bonds. I wish I was alone. I wish I never made friends, never fell in love. These connections bring a lot of joy but they also add these complications and anxiety which is just worse. There's nothing I want more than peace. I just don't want to have all these convoluted emotions in my head. I try to silence them but the noise just does not go away. 

I am tired of these thoughts, the anxiety, the heaviness it all brings. I just want to be at peace with myself.",3,3
757,666,"I feel I'm not enough for Ella. I feel that I'm so worthless and useless and not good enough for her. She is so much more than me. I see nothing in myself and I feel I've been dragging her down with my sadness. Lately I haven't been doing well and I'm sorry for not voicing out. It's extremely hard for me to speak up because I've never had anyone care for me and my feelings. I've always bottled up how I felt and never talked about it. Every night I lay in bed thinking about where I'm gonna be and it always ends up with me dead. 

She is what gives me motivation and drives me to be a better person. Without her I have no idea where I would be. My parents and I have never been on a close enough level to talk about our feelings. I feel if I tell them I will be viewed differently and looked down upon. I hate this but there's not much I can do. 

When she found out about how I really felt I felt relief and better. I felt as if a million bricks were taken off my shoulder. When she told me my sister found out my heart dropped, I was so scared she was gonna think that I'm not some tough guy and just some softie. But it wasn't all that bad. 

Everyday I struggle with my looks. I hate my hair, my voice, my face, my personality. I hate me. I don't know what she sees in me. I have no friends, no social life. There are days where I wish I don't wake up. I wish a bus would hit me. Some days I feel nothing. I may in bed wanting to cry but nothing happens. I can't even cry and sometimes that's what I need. Whenever I hear some one laugh I always think it's about me. I'm just a loser. 

I think I'm in love with Ella. I always want to be with her and see a bright future if she stays with me. I can see some little kids running around the house and us cooking dinner. I think it would be amazing to be in her future. I've never felt love but I think Ella is showing me. She has been bringing me to social events and getting me in there. I love it.",3,3
758,667,"I don't feel I have friends, I have people I know and it's fun to hang around, but I don't have anybody to explain my problems to that would stay and listen and help me how I need to be helped. Most likely if I tried with the people I know, they will just tell me it's normal to feel that way, comfort me for a while and keep with their day without looking back at me twice to make sure I am okay. 

My family is okay, they don't hate me, and I don't hate them. But we have sort of a cold relationship. We care little for one another, and although we enjoy seeing each other and spend time together, it's not that I feel too connected to them. 

My studies right now don't fill me in any way. I am just continuing what the people around me expect me to do, doing a degree that suits my interests (if I had any). And yes, now and then I do have fun and enjoy the lessons. But it always comes back to the point of indifference. 

I don't know what I am doing with my life, and not sure that I want to do anything with it. Not because I am lazy and prefer to do leisure activities, but because I don't have willpower to even spend an afternoon reading or playing. 

It's a horrible feeling to be empty. Of emotions, of care, of anything. And it feels that I am trying to fill a glass that has holes at the bottom, I will fill it if I keep pouring stuff in it, but the second I stop it will lose all its content and I'll end up where I started.",3,3
759,669,"I know there are people SO much worse off than me and all things considered we are incredibly blessed. But this is all still so much. We had significant water damage and were fortunate to have a friend's family's company tear out everything that was damaged. This is great because there are some poor people out there who won't get anyone coming out for days or weeks, creating far worse issues. I'm thankful for that. 

With the gutting, our house is unlivable mostly because of our animals. If it was just us, it'd be doable. But our dog and cat completely prohibit us from being there safely. There is too much stuff and really with the dust and 90% of the house ripped up/things moved around it's tight. We can still do laundry and use the bathrooms so we got that going for us. 

Our friend is incredible and got us a really nice pet friendly hotel at a hugely discounted price. This has been a lifesaver for now. I'm very thankful for that. Most importantly our jobs are remote. If they weren't, I have no idea what we could possibly be doing. Our everyday life has been disrupted but at least we can still work althought it's very stressful and unstable to work with all this on my mind. 

I've been trying to be the strong one with my wife and pets, but occasionally I just break down and cry. And I am not a cryer. In fact my wife laments my lack of emotion many times. I've cried probably 5 times in the last few days. It's just really shitty. 

I cannot fathom what the people who truly lost everything are going through. Whose house swept away or come back to find all their earthly possessions 5 feet under water That really makes me emotional. But I don't want to diminish our situation either because this is hard as well, and extremely uncertain. 

Finding someone to fix this and make our place liveable again. I wish I could snap a finger and go to sleeping in our own bed and watching TV and not stressing.",3,3
760,670,"My mom has done so much for me. But she also has done a lot of bad. A lot that's hurt me. I hope she can see that I was always trying to look out for her. I hope she knows that I didn't like the men she brought home because they were mean to me. I hope she knows that I wanted her to be happy. 

I hope she knows I didn't lie about him pissing on my bed. I hope she knows I didn't lie about him threatening to kill me. I hope she knows I never lied about him drinking vodka as soon as he woke up. I hope she knows I was scared for my life. 

I hope she knows I tried to help when he hit her. I hope she knows I wanted to forgive her. I hope she knows I did all I could to explain and excuse your actions. 

But I was my own mother. I had to deal with all of her feelings and all of her burdens, she made them mine. I was alone. I never had friends. SHe KNEW I, as a 15 year old, was in a relationship with a 24 year old man. She offered to fly me to him. She was a bad mom. 

And I will never forgive her.",3,3
761,671,"I don't wanna die. I just don't want to exist anymore. I can't see a reason to keep holding on. I feel so burnt out. Everything is just not worth it anymore. The fire I had in me to help people is gone. I trust no one. 

I'm scared that if they see how broken I am inside, they'll run away. If they see all the trauma and pain that they'll run away like others before. That they'll deem me just not worth the effort. I don't know how to talk to people and interact. Years of being cooped up in a house with just my family. Being punished for being out too long with friends. Having friends in some cases. 

And then being yelled at because I get nervous ordering for myself or interacting with strangers. I want to feel love and be loved. But I have no idea what it feels like. I can't feel anything anymore, but if I do, it's only the extreme sadness that one calls depression. 

I hate that I've been brainwashed so much by my family that I can't even reach out. I get so nervous. I don't want to feel like a burden. And when they ask me how I am? I lie. I can't control it. I've been intrinsically programmed to lie and say I'm fine when I'm not. 

I hate that I can't even scream anymore. It is impossible for me physically to scream. I just can't. Crying is a challenge as well. I've barely even shed a tear even though I'm crying on the inside. Wailing, even. 

I hate that I can't even walk across the street or even sleep without a traumatic memory resurfacing. Group Therapy gets me nowhere. The meds don't work. Therapy helps, but with how busy my Therapist is at times I don't see her as much as I used to. 

I just don't want to exist anymore. But I have no choice.",3,3
762,672,"Years ago I fell in love with a girl. I was a teen so I thought it's just a big crush and I'll experience feelings like that more in my life. I never confessed because I felt like I wasn't good enough for her. We stayed friendly with each other for a year but stopped talking to each other eventually. (Mostly on my part, I couldn't bear the feelings for her so I distanced myself). After that I forgot about the way I felt and started dating others. 

I never really thought about it much as I'm not an emotional person. I thought I'll fall in love again sooner or later. After years, when I was in a relationship with someone else, I started meeting her again. I realized that the feelings are back. Not only that but I realized I love her more than I could ever love my girlfriend at the time (the relationship was toxic, no need to feel bad). In fact no feelings I had for other people could measure up to the love I had for her. 

We weren't too friendly with each other but we'd occasionally talk. Every word she said made my feelings for her come back. The things I loved about her before didn't change, she became even more lovely now. 

After months of talking (I was single already) I confessed to her. We weren't talking much, I don't blame her but she rejected me. Even though I was expecting it, it did hurt. I wanted to confess so I'm ""free"". So I can finally get closure and leave my feelings behind. 

The problem is I still can't. It's been a year and I don't think about her much but I just don't like other people. I don't even have crushes anymore. My interest in people doesn't last for longer than a few days. I've met hundreds of people since I've met her and there are people interested in me but I'm just not able to like someone again. Everyone seems so bland. 

As I said I don't think about her much, it's not like I'm still too attached. I just don't have feelings for others. I'm aware she's just another girl with flaws and that there are definitely similar people. But I just can't feel the same love for other girls.",3,3
763,673,"I'm only 17 years old and I know that every 17 year old probably thinks like this but I'm 100% certain. I have never seen an uglier person in my whole life than when I look in the mirror. My face is covered with acne along with my chest and back. I've always been a side sleeper so over the years my face has become lop sided and my nose is crooked. My forehead is ginormous and I've gotten bangs to cover it but the wind always exposes me. I have scars on my arms and thighs that look hideous. I have weird looking fingers and feet. My ears are massive and my teeth are crooked. I feel like every single thing on my body has been made disproportionally or just plain ugly. 

My entire life I've read books and watched films about the main character finding love and living happily ever after but I know I'll never get to experience that. I can't imagine anyone looking at me or thinking about me in that way. I've spoken to friends and family members about how I feel and they tell me I'm attractive but there's no way they're being honest. I see photos of myself taken at school and I look awful. 

I've thought about getting surgeries to fix these things in the future but I know I need to just learn to love myself and deal with how I look instead of changing.",3,3
764,674,"I moved away from my home country to live free when I was 19. I didn't want to live in a third world country. I hated the lack of freedom. I got accepted to a college abroad, but my parents couldn't support me anymore because of currency devaluation. I hated seeing my dad work so hard; I always feared that if his health deteriorated because of me, I would never be able to forgive myself. 

They can't help me. I had to quit my school and I found a job. I worked 3 and a half years and quit afterwards due to problems in my workplace. Meanwhile I dealt with my physical health problems and supported myself without the help of my parents. I saved up and invested so that I would have enough money to live around 15 months. 

Now I am trying to setup my own business, earn money by freelancing, doing anything to get ahead, to show what I am capable of. To have good people around me. To live free. To not lose my freedom. 

I am 24, unemployed and without capital to start my business; my savings are getting lower by the day and I feel a bit scared. A couple of ventures I tried already failed. I made some money meanwhile, but it is by no means enough. 

A good friend of mine told me I should finish my degree because otherwise, I am just a hustler. If you finish your degree, you would be a professional hustler, he said. I hate to break it to him. I don't have money to pay for college, and I can't get a loan to pay for it because I am an immigrant and have nothing to back it up, and even if I did, I would be in debt and 28 years old by the time I graduate.

765,675,"I have been dating my boyfriend for almost two months now and I still can't seem to like, let alone fall in love with, him. I know it sounds bad and maybe I should just break up with him but the truth is that I feel bad and I'll admit that I'm being selfish. Even though he's not the most handsome or richest guy I've been with, he is definitely the one that treats me the best. He treats me like a queen and remembers the smallest details, for example, he would open the car door for me every time and he would buy me snacks that I just said I craved for a split second and forgot about until he puts it in my hands. He is honestly everything I hoped for in a boyfriend but I just can't get myself to like him in that way. 

I don't feel the emotional connection with him like I did with my ex. I have an ex that I was crazily in love with no matter how bad he was and I can't seem to feel that way with my current boyfriend even though he has all the qualities I wished for. Sometimes I find my boyfriend quite annoying and those are the moments where I do want to break up with him but then the second he does something sweet to me I just feel bad for breaking up. 

I'm not the most patient person but he's been nothing but patient with me and I just feel so bad for everything. He tells me he loves me but I can't even say it to him as a lie. I know I'm being selfish for not breaking up with him because I can't lie I do enjoy being treated so well since all my past relationships were either emotionally abusive or physically abusive. I've dreamt of my prince charming with all his qualities but I don't know what's wrong with me for not liking him. 

I still do the things a girlfriend is supposed to do and treat him well but it sometimes feel like a chore. I've never cheated on anyone and would never cheat on him either. I feel like an asshole and just don't know what to do anymore.",3,3
766,677,"Ive been in a lot of bad relationships. I had been in an awful emotionally abusive relationship when I met this guy who I saw as my hero. He helped me realize I had to get out of that relationship, and then we dated for almost 2 years. I thought he was the one, my soulmate, the person I was gonna marry. 

But he dumped me out of the blue and I didn't understand and my world collapsed around me. I'd been through a lot and didn't think I could take another heartbreak. I had some awful nights with dark thoughts for a while and truly really thought this would destroy me and I'd never be happy again. 

But I could. I got through it. And tonight, over 3 months after I got dumped, I am laying in bed next to my new boyfriend who in such a short time has made me happier than I ever was with my last ex. I'm so glad I got dumped because if I didn't I wouldn't be as happy as I am now and would've stayed forever with someone who, to be fair, didn't mistreat me but honestly didn't make me that happy. 

My current boyfriend is someone I've been friends with for years and I've never felt as safe and happy and cared for and I'm so glad I gave it a chance. The horrible event (getting dumped without ever getting a decent explanation) that I thought was going to destroy me was a blessing in disguise. 

I didn't realize that being with someone that genuinely valued me and cared for my feelings and needs and treated me well was an option. I almost want to cry from how happy I am. I'm glad I didn't get consumed by the dark thoughts back then.",3,3

I've had plenty of girlfriends and friends in those later years, but turns out they were all toxic or never cared for me in the first place. I got friends now but what I yearn for is the love of a woman. I've tried and tried to find someone who won't turn their back on me or stab it, I've been cheated on, thrown under the bus, beaten, and even outright stolen from. 

To be honest I'm scared to date now or even trust anyone close enough to share my desires or interests with. I want to start dating again. I want to make new and better friends. But it's hard in the hookup culture to find a good woman or even someone I can talk to. 

I'm downright terrified of letting someone in due to fear of my heart being blown up.",3,3
768,681,"Ever since my last failed relationship, I have been super hesitant to try to meet anyone new. Well, I decided to try again. I matched with this really respectful and sweet guy on hinge and I felt things were going well. We were going to meet up over the weekend. 

Due to his job, he disappears for days at a time sometimes and honestly I get it, and I'm not mad by it. I wanted more communication, but I didn't want to be that needy chick that's asking for the full girlfriend treatment before the first date. 

Well the weekend came and went with no word from him, but come Sunday, he posts on his Snapchat without answering me. My stomach dropped and I felt so ignored. It's a feeling I was so familiar with in my last relationship that all I could think was that I didn't want to feel that way anymore. 

So I unadded him and explained to him why on hinge. And now I just feel like I should've tried to talk it out with him before immediately jumping to unadding and cutting my losses. Maybe it's my nature of wanting to give second chances, maybe it's because he was so kind and considerate. 

I've told him I'm willing to talk about communication but I think he's cutting his losses now, and I don't blame him. I hope I get a better grip on my feelings.",3,3
769,683,"One of my friends asked me who my closest friend was and I said I didn't have any mostly as a joke but I was thinking about my friends a while after the conversation ended and I don't know if I like any of my friends all that much. I usually try to hang out with them and stuff and they're fun people but I don't feel like I'm having fun around any of them and I usually laugh to the things they say so it doesn't get awkward with me staring at them. 

I also used to have a girlfriend who I thought I was in love with but my dad went through my phone and found out and we basically had to stop talking. I thought I was scared at first because I couldn't talk to her anymore but I realized soon that it was actually fear of what my dad would think about me. I also realized later that I felt relieved to be out of the relationship. It's not that she was a bad person or anything. I think I just didn't love her. 

I wish I had someone who would hug me at night. I don't really have anyone and it kinda sucks. I honestly don't even care about gender. I just want to sleep while someone hugs me.",3,3
770,684,"I have a friend B who I have known for around a year now and her mom is the worst person I have ever met. Here are just some of the things she has done that really pissed me off. 

B tells her mom everything. And then her mom tells my mom everything. Now my mother knows all about my problems, worries and wishes. She constantly annoys both me and my family by shoving B's grades and school stuff in our faces. When B does something that I forgot/didn't do she mentions it whenever she can. On a call? Meeting in real life? She has to bring it up. 

She forced me to study with B many times even when I already knew everything. She humiliated me in front of family many times. She acts like I'm a dumb child. 

It might seem like I'm overreacting but she has done this so many times. So I cut all contact with her. I stopped texting her, I told B to not tell her a word about me, I stopped showing up when we had to meet and I stopped answering her calls. 

It felt great, it felt like I was finally free again and it's the best feeling I have ever felt and I don't regret a thing.",3,3
771,685,"I lost my dad at a young age which didn't help my mother. She was married off at a young age and then lost my dad when she was 39. I come from an orthodox community, so she didn't remarry. She dedicated her life to kids. My brother and I had a good education and everything we needed to survive. She is 58 now. 

Then a few years ago my brother got diagnosed with a chronic disease right after his wedding. He left his job, his wife divorced him, his health is still recovering. He lost it all at once. Now he lives with my mother. 

I've faired a tiny bit better. I have a good job, I have amazing friends and a long term relationship which my family doesn't know about. 

I recently came back home after a few months and notice that both of them are depressed - or at least show clear signs of unhappiness. The home is not as clean as it should be. My mother's mood is never as happy as it used to be. It's not a family unit. 

I have stopped talking to my brother because he took out his frustrations on us and on top of that his erratic personality was too much for me to handle so I just cut him off entirely so I don't have to worry about him. 

No matter what I do, my mother won't be happy because my brother lost control of his life. It's not his fault she is unhappy but he does nothing to calm her. My mother clearly needs more mental and physical support, and I can't do it her way. 

I want to live my life with happiness and I have such a supportive partner but all this is too much to handle. And I feel trapped. 

I want them to understand that I also lost a father, that I also went through my brother's condition, that I lost both my mother and brother in that process. I feel so unhappy.",3,3
772,686,"My long distance boyfriend and I have been going out for a year now. We haven't met each other in real life but we have been planning to for a while now. Our situations are just complicated. At the start, just before we started dating, he was a great guy, honestly. He was amazing, he was caring and we seemed to have a lot in common. I really felt like he cared for me. 

But come seven months into the actual relationship his whole personality changed. He became more obsessive and controlling, I've had to cut all my male friends off and he doesn't even want me talking to his mates. He's picky over what I wear when I go out because he doesn't want other guys staring at me. 

More recently he's somehow convinced me to send nudes to him, which was something I promised myself I'd never do. Thinking about it, he's managed to get me to do a lot of things I promised myself I'd never do. 

We had a conversation a while back and somehow got on the conversation of cheating. He told me if I ever cheated he would basically kill whoever I cheated with, but that he would never hurt me. 

Anyways last night we were talking about seeing each other and again he bought up cheating. He told me if I ever cheated on him that he'd kill whoever I cheated with and then me. He also said if I even tried to leave he'd kill me. 

I don't know if he's serious or not but he's only in the next state and he knows my address. Also I'm scared he'll use my nudes against me. 

Also I can't imagine being without him, I miss how he was, he knows a lot of my personal issues here at home and he has helped me through so much. I am attached to him. I love him. I'm not sure if I'm scared of him but I also kind of am.",3,3
773,687,"I can finally afford to quit my job for a couple months. I have to have a month notice before leaving. I have a job lined up. I have back pain after getting hit by a drunk driver 2 years ago. I got a job delivering newspapers last December. It has made my back worse. 

I'm getting the settlement money finally and going to see an actual back doctor which I unfortunately have to pay for myself. This job basically only pays for my car payment, gas and barely groceries in 1 month. My boyfriend is the main money maker. He got this new job making more and said ""ok you can quit"". I'm so relieved and so thankful for him. 

I'm so tired of being abused in customer service. It's really getting to me and maybe not so shockingly, old people are mean in the morning. I'm so tired of being blinded EVERY single morning by people who don't care about their brights. People tailgating me at 4 am when I'm trying to not hit deer or other animals. I've never had a job this early and people are so miserable in the morning. 

This job makes me want to never drive again because people are just so inconsiderate when driving. It really makes me sad. I'm just full of stress and I've let it bubble up these past couple months. For the first time in like 6 months I see a brighter light.",3,3
774,688,"I hate my mistakes. I hate the fact I made these mistakes. And I feel like I'll hate myself for it for the rest of my life. 

I've been around plenty of people. I wouldn't say they were all completely normal. Half the time, my friend groups would get into drama and I'd get scooped up into it and we'd all act like we were fine. I've made a lot of mistakes. A lot of the people I had around damaged me emotionally and psychologically. But, that doesn't excuse the fact I did that to others too. 

I've gotten out of those toxic friendships. And I've gotten better and even made new friendships but, word gets around you know? It doesn't get to me and I never had any reason to believe that other people would talk bad about me but, I have a gut feeling people are saying things about me. It's killing me. 

I've done my best to try to amend my past mistakes, but that doesn't mean people forget. God knows I haven't forgotten what other people did to me. I've been better now, really. But, I believe when you're around toxic people, you do toxic things, and even though that's no excuse for my behavior I kinda hope it helps other people understand why I did what I did. 

I've reconciled with myself but I feel bad for getting this feeling that others probably don't care if I'm sorry. And that's understandable. I've tried to let go and I thought everything was fine but, people hold grudges longer than I do. 

I understand why I did what I did. But I also understand that I hurt people the same way they hurt me and I regret that so much. I feel like my life is being sewn together and ripped apart every time I try to heal from my mistakes. It's annoying. 

I hate myself. I know mistakes are human but I hate the fact that I feel like people hate me.",3,3
775,691,"A country border and 2000+ miles separate us. We both said we can stick through it but that was 3 years ago and we didn't have much going on in life. Now she started university after her surgical recovery and I'm getting my career started. We have complete different schedules and not being in the same time zone isn't doing anyone any favors. 

We've met 4 times now and loved each other deeply during because we both know those are the only times we could interact physically but the last two times weren't so great for me. She always asks and begs for gifts but can't give me back anything close to what I give her. 

There's a financial imbalance of a couple thousand dollars now in the relationship not including travel costs I pay for. Every $500 of gifts I give her I receive something totalling $50 back. 

If we were just closer and meet much more frequently, if she were getting her career started as well or finishing up college, if she gives back as much as she asks for, if I don't have to spend over $700 just for a flight to see her, maybe it could work out better.",3,3
776,694,"I got in a bad car accident 3 weeks ago and I was put on crutches indefinitely. Because of this I've unfortunately become my family's main focus. I live with my parents and 3 brothers and I am constantly babied or assisted by them. And while having food brought to you and being treated like a princess sounds nice, it's a lot worse than it sounds. 

The worst of it all would be the bathing part of it. I felt the sharpest pain ever, slipped, and hit my head in the tub. I was honestly pretty dazed but before I knew it my family had burst into the bathroom and my dad was already lifting me out of the tub. I wasn't drowning or anything because I just started the water but they immediately took me to the ER. 

And even though I was fine, after that incident, my parents refused to let me do things unsupervised like get in the bath myself. And because they're usually working, after that first week the responsibility went to my 3 brothers. And my sanity hasn't been the same ever since. 

The problem is I hate the fact that my brothers constantly see me naked now. I can't help but feel extremely aware and embarrassed about everything. The thing about being overly aware of everything is I'm short and skinny but not exactly petite, so I have curves and constantly think about them having a full view of it. 

I honestly dont know how to get over this and there's still no real answer to when I'll be able to walk on my own again. I even tried to not take baths for a few days; but the fact that I need help to do so, my brothers know that I'm not. While they help, siblings are siblings and love to tease you about anything. 

I feel so very insecure about my own body, even the clothes I sleep in. I never had the reason to care about it so much until now.",3,3
777,695,"""You are so smart."" That phrase has been told to me since I was kid. I felt special when I was told this so I did everything I could to get that phrase told to me by my peers, parents and teachers. Even got into college with a pretty big scholarship. 

But now that I am in my second year of college, I am massively struggling as I now see that my crutches, in form of extra credit, scheduling that was given to me, caring teachers, are gone. I stay up late, doing homework, studying trying to remember the infomation that i understand but can't retain, but it's not enough to pass tests that were supposed to be easy. 

I feel like I was never that smart, just lucky. The little voice in the back of my head is telling me that everything that I have built up over the years should just be burned down, that I don't deserve to be in college. I should just let myself flunk out and let my family, friends, and everyone see me as what I am, an idiot who got a bit of luck and doesn't deserve the praise she got over the years.",3,3
778,696,"This happened 3 years ago when I was 15. So about 4 years ago my sister met her boyfriend who is also the father to her child. I really enjoyed being around him and he was always so nice. Whenever he'd come up to visit us (before he moved in) he'd always bring my sister and I something. He's always been willing to spend money on me. 

A couple months after they met he moved in. I slept in my sister's room with them. A little after we'd all (or so I thought) fallen asleep, I woke up to his hands on me. He barely touched my actual private areas (although it did happen a few times). He would also kiss my head/face and every-time I tried to move away from him he would kind of just hold me there so I couldn't. 

This happened another 2 times (which I blame myself for as I kept putting myself in that situation. But again I was 15. I figured it was normal). He also said something the first time, telling me not to tell anyone. He also had asked sometime during the night when I finally left, and he followed me out, if I had slept at all. I said yes and he said he didn't. 

After the last time of it happening I told my sister and my mother. Later they both talked to him and of course he apologised but he said he was asleep so he doesn't remember doing anything. And he couldn't give an explanation for a fair portion of what he did/said. They believed him, said I misread the situation. 

I just want some closure. It's been on my mind everyday since.",3,3
779,697,"My ex broke up with me around 2 years ago. We started dating when we were 17. She was my first everything. We moved in with each other when we were 20 and lived together for a few years. She left me with very little warning and almost no info. Essentially ghosted me for a week, packed up most of her stuff when I wasn't home, then had a 20 minute talk about not being happy anymore. 

2 years later and I'm still not over it. I went on a couple tinder dates early on, thinking it would help. It didn't. I haven't even tried to date in the last year. 

The funny thing is, I don't even want her back. I haven't talked to her since we broke up, other than wishing each other happy holidays, and I have no desire to. But anytime I get on a dating app, I can't help but compare them to her. I don't know how I'm supposed to have any meaningful connection with another woman if all I can think about is how they stack up to her. It's not healthy for me, and not at all fair to the other person. 

I recently scheduled an appointment to see a therapist. If I'm being honest, I should have starting seeing one immediately after the break up considering how much of a mess I was.",2,2
780,698,"My ex and myself had been together for the last 6 years. Our relationship wasn't doing well in the last year in which she was very upset in our position in life and due to me just getting a good position at a growing company, this would mean we would not have been able to move across the country as we intended right away. At this time we've been sleeping separately the last 3 months and I've been trying to make her happy, but she did not grow towards this idea of staying here longer. She then ended things saying she was going to move there herself. 

After a couple of weeks this turned into staying in this area. She confirmed that she was going to stay in the area but she did not want to stay with me and wanted to live alone. I was devastated. Throughout this whole time I was already depressed that things were ending because she wanted to move without me and now it feels like it's just me. She did not want me. 

So at this point weeks have passed and we have a month left on our lease until we both move out. I met someone who is really cool and I enjoy talking to. She's firtatious, funny, and attractive. She is a very aware of my situation and still talks to me. Nothing physical has happened yet with this new girl but as of late she has sent me some spicy messages asking to come over. I wanna go for it. It's been 8 months since the last time I've been touched. 

I was going to go over to do the deed the other night when my ex came back to the apartment in tears regarding some terrible news about her family and she feels her life is falling apart. I sympathize with her and I felt terrible for her. In my heart I couldn't go and meet this other woman now. We've been trying to be respectful of the situation and I know we're not together but it felt wrong. So I decided to take a nap instead. 

To be clear I wouldn't get back with my ex if she begged. If I'm not your first choice after 6 years I'm not your last resort now is how I feel about it. Still though I could not shake the feeling that I was doing something wrong. I'm still messaging the other girl and I think I'm gonna set up a date and see what happens.",2,2
781,699,"My mom has always been a good mom. She took care of 2 kids going to 2 different schools with one of them having half custody with her dad. When I was 5 my mom met my stepdad and soon enough they had another boy. Up until this point my mother had given no reason for me to dislike her. But this all took a turn for the worse when COVID came around. My mother lost her job but because of non-covid related reasons and she got off her anxiety medication because it was starting to make her lose weight. 

Once when my mom was arguing with my stepdad she started bawling her eyes out and I asked why and she admitted she had depression. That's all I know about her medical conditions. 

In 2020 she started being horrible to my sister even though she was the oldest sibling and did the most around the house. And a few months ago, my step dad and mom fighting became a bi weekly thing. She threatened to break up with him almost every time they got into a argument. 

About 2 months ago, we moved into a better house that could better fit 5 people and 2 dogs. It only gotten worse from there. She would get mad because the house was going to be under my stepdad's name until they got married in about 6 months and she said she would move back into her old house and never see him again. 

But instead of it being a bi weekly thing, it now happens every single day. And I don't know how to deal with it. Me and my sister have to just sit in our rooms and hope our little brother isn't hearing every word they say. Even though we know for a fact he is. I hear her threatening to commit suicide, to give us away to our grandmother. 

I don't know what to do. I'm still a minor and can't live without my parents. I can't even stand to look at my mom anymore. I hate her. And I don't think I will ever take that back. No matter how many ""heartfelt"" apologies she gives me after literally threatening to kick me out in a way where she doesn't have any repercussions.",3,3
782,7,"I started working for the Park Service when I was in high school. That turned into 15 years of working for the park service. When the position at Grand Canyon came up I was like, great, awesome opportunity, I'm gonna go for it. Our office here, we have public affairs and communications. We deal with everything from media requests, to filming permits, visitor information, Congressional and legislative affairs, international affairs. We've got this huge scope that we deal with on a day-to-day basis. So no day is the same. There's never a dull day. 

But it was daunting. I remember driving across the country by myself totally freaked out. I haven't worked, I haven't done this job before. I'm going to one of the most recognizable places in the world. I'm going to have to speak on behalf of the park. What did I just get myself into? 

But I don't need to be remembered as the spokesperson of Grand Canyon. As an Asian-American working for the National Park Service, we always wanna make sure that people understand that these are their parks. These are places where anyone can come. It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, what your background is. It doesn't matter if you're rich or you are poor. 

A park is a public place and it's open to anyone to come and hopefully find some inspiration, and make a connection with, so they can continue to come back to these places.",2,2
783,701,"Around one month ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, citing financial difficulties due to our vast financial circumstances and lifestyles that we are accustomed to. It sucked because I still loved her so dearly, but it was just the wrong timing for the both of us. 

Ever since that break-up, it was extremely difficult for me - I was practically immobile for at least two weeks as I was filled up with melancholy from the breakup. After that period, I felt better, although I still missed her from time to time. Deep down, I still loved her, but because it was the wrong timing, I just accepted, moved on, and continued living my life. 

Fast forward until yesterday, out of the blue, she texted me and asked me if I still had any feelings for her. I knew I should have just moved on, but I replied to her instead. One thing led to another, and I found myself with her again. This is the fifth time we have gotten back together after a break. 

The night we got back together, I felt extremely uneasy and full of trepidation - that is already a bad sign. I could not sleep, full of thoughts and wondering if what I did was right for us. This unification felt off for the first time. I still loved her so dearly, but part of me just does not want to repeat this vicious cycle all over again as it is just so draining. 

As much as I hate to say this, love alone is not enough at this point to carry us anymore. How much more must we be subjected to this cycle when history has proven, time after time, that it is not suitable for both of us? It may look stupid from her perspective to end it, but I must do it to protect my sanity and myself.",3,3
784,704,"My best friend accused me of hooking up with her boyfriend and now won't talk to me. Me and Ashley have been friends since we were 11-12 in the 6th grade. She met Jacob during junior year of high school and they have been dating for almost a year now. 

I am a very shy person and don't really like to talk to people I don't know very much so me and Jacob had never really made conversation at all other than the occasional hey or hi. Ashley on the other hand was a very energetic happy go lucky girl and had always tried to push me and Jacob to be closer because as she says, How can my boyfriend and best friend not get along? Me and Jacob do get along but more as acquainted strangers than anything else. 

Now this started during our senior year when Jacob started failing his math class and math had always been my strong suit and I was very confident in it. But that was when Ashley came up with the brilliant idea of me tutoring him. I was reluctant at first because we weren't close to begin with and me tutoring this guy I barely know kind of scared me but she mentioned he would be paying me so I agreed. 

And so I started tutoring Jacob after school for about one to two hours or so with Ashley of course but she got bored and decided she didn't want to wait anymore and so it was just me and Jacob. But because I was spending after school with Jacob we got closer and became friends, but that was all. 

I guess Ashley noticed this change and started being suspicious that we became closer when she was the one who wanted it. She confronted me without warning of any kind in front of everyone and I was surprised and confused and me not being used to confrontation started crying which I guess made her think that it was true. 

I've been trying to text and call her but she's blocked me on everything and won't listen to my explanation at all. Me and Jacob have talked about it and he's just as confused as I am.",2,2
785,706,"Today, I got to stay home from school, and it's not for a ""I don't wanna go"" reason. It's because I genuinely needed it, and my mom came into my room this morning after us both waking up late. She woke me up. After I did, she said it was 6:48. I have to leave at 6:50. I was super tired and she said she would drive me, so I went back to sleep for a bit. 

She woke me back up and I couldn't keep my eyes open.My mom came in and asked why I wasn't ready, I said that my school is far away and she has work in 10 minutes. She said it was fine, but my school is 20 minutes away tops. So she asked why I was making this excuse and I told her I just was stressed. 

And it's true, I have many missing assignments from when I was sick with strep and more. There were fights, and a girl almost died last week. People are bullying me, and I also had to move to a new school. 

So she said ""you can have a mental health day. Just today, you can have only 1 next week."" She's amazing, I love her with all my heart.",3,3
786,707,"I just went into a new school this year and it's been 3 months. I have this friend who was the first ever friend I made in this new school. Out of nowhere she stopped initiating conversations and just completely stopped waiting for me after class (we usually walk to our next classes together since we have almost the same classes) and also stopped eating lunch with me and just kept going to the library instead. 

I talked to my other friend about it and she mentioned that she might be feeling left out because she has two other friends that she hangs out with and I joined in. I'm usually a quiet person but her friends are really nice so I got along with them pretty quickly. 

Ever since I started hanging out with the 3 of them, she goes quiet. I always try adding her to the conversation and asking her questions and stuff but she only replies in one word answers and never tries to continue the conversation. 

A while after this, she starts doing the same thing during our personal conversations. She stops talking to me completely and even picks a different partner for every 2-person project in class (we used to always pick each other as partners). 

I don't know what to do, maybe I accidentally stole her friends? Is she mad at me? Am I supposed to drop my friends because of her? I don't know what the right thing to do is. She was my first ever friend in this school so I don't want to lose her, but I also became really good friends with her two friends and I don't have any other close friends in this school.",2,2
787,708,"I'm a teenage girl in my junior year of high school. As a kid, someone I trusted took advantage of me, and it took me until I was 14 to realize that it wasn't my fault. This was someone that was older than me by 5 years and knew what he was doing. I didn't, and he tricked me into doing things I deeply regret now. 

I'm still struggling now with this realization because for the longest time I tried to convince myself it didn't even happen. It has made me scared of guys and their intentions. Fear spikes in my chest whenever a guy tries to befriend me. I'm terrified for my friends when they like guys because I'm scared they'll be hurt by someone. I don't ever voice that to them because I know it's irrational, but it's obvious I'm uncomfortable and that bothers them. 

I wish this didn't impact my life so much. I feel bad for immediately assuming every guy is dangerous, but I can't help it. I don't know what to do about it. 

This also impacts my relationships with my female friends because I avoid spending time with them when they're around guys. I haven't told them why I'm like this because it feels like I'm overreacting. 

There are guys I'm friends with, but they're not close to me. They're online friends that I play video games with. I don't have in-person guy friends. 

I don't feel like I have a right to feel this way because there are women out there who went through worse, yet they don't struggle the way I do.",3,3
788,711,"I live with a roommate who is a textbook narcissist with mildly psychopathic streaks. He has the confidence to regularly talk down to me and I, with my diplomatically accommodating attitude have handled it with grace and even excused this behaviour. Why do I let him go this far? 

TODAY, he tried to lecture me on contracts - I, a newly graduated law student. Towering over me in a power pose with his arms on his hips, feet heavily planted like an elephant a yard from each other and peppered with his usual derogative aura and loud explanative tone. I just COULD not deal with this any longer. I put my foot down. I read him the riot act in a concise and unmistakably determined way, still sticking to the subject matter. 

And guess what? He actually dared turn this around to being a conversation about his victimisation! That I gave him a feeling of having to ""walk on eggshells."" After the sexist, racist and degrading comments he casually makes at people, perhaps he should try walking on eggshells. What a manipulative, low-life loser. 

I have had enough of this and it feels like I've taken and taken and taken this behaviour up until a point where I'm about to burst. And sadly, his shrewdness in gaslighting people into thinking he was the victim is working! How dared I be so uncharacteristically harsh and assert my knowledge? 

The story doesn't end here. Afterwards, he comes up and offers me chips. Asks me to perform a favour for him. And here is the catch: I do it. I held the door for him when he asked me to. Because after all, who wants to be a villian? I am nice. Nice, nice, nice, nice to death. I can't stand people and I can't stand myself.",3,3

3 months before I met my current boyfriend, I dated someone else for a few months and fell completely in love. We only dated for about 3 months, and it was the most PG relationship ever, but I really did fall in love with him. he called things off in february because he couldn't give me the time and commitment we would have needed, but mid march we decided we'd try again after summer. 

 

In may, I met my current boyfriend on Hinge, and we hit it off amazingly well. I, obviously, completely trashed the idea of getting back with my ex in the future. 

 

Fast forward to the present, though, and some things made me think about him again. I have dreams about him and I find myself comparing things my boyfriend does/doesn't do to what he would've. I can't bear the idea of breaking up with my boyfriend, but if I think about my ex, I see myself being really happy with him too. 

 

Sometimes I get sad that my boyfriend doesnt do cuter things for me or say cute things to me very much, and I can't help but compare that to my ex and think about how he did and said more, sweeter things to me in 3 months than my boyfriend has in 2 years. 

 

I'm really a hopeless romantic at heart, but I push it down because I know my boyfriend doesnt express love like that. I feel extremely guilty and have no idea what to do. I keep telling myself it's just because he was my first real love and part of that will never go away, but I'm not sure I fully believe that. 

I really don't want to leave my boyfriend, but there are times when i really miss my ex and our relationship.",3,3
790,715,"I had a baby FOUR months ago with my boyfriend and just now was able to get in to see my doctor to get birth control in my arm that lasts 3 years and is 99% effective. I obviously had to test negative to be able to get it. However I never got my period so I took a test with literally no idea that it would be positive. It turns out it is very positive. 

I am struggling and don't know what to do. I support anyone's choice to have an abortion and would never judge. However, for me personally I'm not sure how it would affect me long term. How could I choose one baby and not the other? I would watch my child grow up knowing there was supposed to be another child. 

But also I'm 22 and in nursing school trying to provide a life for my child and I feel like I haven't gotten any time alone with him. I am in love with being a mom and never felt like I had purpose until I became one. 

My partner and I just started the closing process on our first house and we are together long term so I do have a support system and I'm a little bit unsure as to how he feels but I know he's struggling too and is already extremely tired from working long hours. He's a great dad and definitely enjoys being one.",3,3
791,718,"I just want to cry. I'm so absent-minded and I feel like it's ruined my life. I don't even know how to stop being absent-minded. I've never been able to pay attention in school at all. I always daydream, yawn, fall asleep, draw, and fidget at school. I'm bad at useful subjects like math and science. I scored the class low on every math test so far. 

Even when I've turned off my phone I somehow find new ways to procrastinate. My sleep schedule is awful because I'm always up completing homework. I don't know how I'll ever adjust to a work setting and it terrifies me. I can't focus because of how fogged up my brain gets. Whenever someone talks to me, I get surprised because I'm usually lost in thought, and it doesn't help that my anxiety causes me to look very nervous and shocked. 

I'm so forgetful, I bought a poster for my room and it took me four months to put it up. Likewise, I also bought lights for my room and it took me an entire year to put it up. My parents will tell me to do something and they'll have to remind me four times to do it and it'll take me like 3 hours to do because of how forgetful I am. 

I see so many of my friends accomplish so much at this age and I just can't seem to do anything. I don't have a job nor do I have my license. If I'm not anxious while driving, I'm probably not paying attention and will make a stupid mistake. My driving instructor had to keep repeating instructions like five seconds after the other because I couldn't focus. I have no idea how to overcome this. 

I feel like I'm not as prepared as other kids my age and I'm very behind. I just feel like I've wasted my life.",3,3
792,719,"I'm 31 years old and my mother and I do not speak to each other currently. Right after I turned 18, my parents put all of my belongings out on the front porch and kicked me out of the house for smoking weed. This is something my mom and I fought over many times and still disagree on to this day. I've been smoking weed for 14 years; I've tried some other stuff, but my only addiction problems are with nicotine. 

At that time, I had a girlfriend that I would stay with, and ended up living there temporarily, after I was kicked out. After 2 days, my mom was begging me to come home, as she'd realized her mistake. Since I was young and a bit rebellious, I told her that I didn't want to come home due to feeling betrayed by my family, and ended up not going home for over 2 months. 

During this time I was supposed to start classes at a local community college, but I also got really sick with pneumonia and didn't have a stable home so I ended up dropping all but one class. Eventually I moved back home and stayed there until I was 26. I moved out for good after we had another fight over me smoking weed. 

Fast forward to now, she tells me that I have anger issues during an argument and that I need help. This started a huge fight that has been going on for a couple months now. My mom blames me as the reason why she had to kick me out, saying everything she did was just a reaction to what I did, plays the victim, tells me that I have anger issues and need therapy. All I wanted was acknowledgement and accountability. She won't apologize and refuses to accept me for who I am and I'm not sure what to do.",3,3
793,720,"Today I talked with a few of my friends about the face reveal of a quite popular person and showed them a picture. Almost immediately they started calling them ugly and compared them to people and characters who are usually seen as unattractive/memes. Personally, I cannot stand such behaviour, it's okay to say ""Yeah, they're not my type"" or that you think one is unattractive but do you really need to shame? 

I told them that and they said that they just were stating an opinion and that it's okay since the person was an asshole in the past. I told them that it doesn't matter what the person did but what they're doing and that I think it's wrong to do so. 

As I too face bodyshaming quite often it definitely hurt. I brought up said experiences and they told me that this is a ""me-problem"" and has nothing to do with the discussion. We are -or were - friends for many years now, we went through so much and for all of them I acted as a therapist, but this is a me-problem? I don't know anymore. 

I left the groupchat afterwards because the discussion kept dragging on and I had worse things happen in my life than discussing about stuff with people who obviously don't care about what I'm even saying. Two of my other friends agreed but they never joined the discussion. 

All I know is that I have facial dysmorphia so someone making fun of one's face is just making me feel worse about me, even though that can't be used as a justification as both of them got bullied and also know how it is to be said horrible things of. They engaged in cancel culture in the past (even though they'd never admit it), so I guess I was stupid for even starting this discussion but it really hurt to see people I called my friends being such assholes to a person about things they cannot control. 

If you're mad about what a person said or did, that is perfectly fine, but bodyshaming someone is just a move of one who doesn't know better. I'm sorry to them if I was being harsh, I didn't sleep well that night and it definitely rubbed a nerve, but I know they're not sorry.",3,3
794,723,"I've been dating this guy for a few months. We met on bumble and he was really nice and cute. He is usually busy studying as he's an engineering student (I am too but he's a grad). A few months ago he asked to be my boyfriend because he didn't want me meeting up with anyone else on bumble. I hadn't been messaging anyone on bumble anyway because we were talking, but I agreed and deleted the app and we became exclusive. 

Lately he hasn't been able to spend time together a lot. Sometimes we go 2 weeks without seeing each other. He'll still text cute things about how I'm his girl and how he misses me but that's about it. I try to give him space because I know studying is hard. 

Well recently my friend told me that even if you delete bumble, your account stays up if you dont delete your account. I was creeped out by this so I downloaded the app to officially delete my account. The very first person I see when I redownload the account is my boyfriend! And not only that, when I scroll to the bottom of his profile, 2 of the pictures were taken while we were dating, one from only a week ago that I took myself. So that means he's actively going on it. 

So instead of texting him to break up, I decided to be an immature brat. So I asked my friend for her account and swiped until I found his account. She looks similar to me and I know she'd be his type. They never met. Then I messaged him and let him chat her profile up until he asked for a date on Saturday. 

Guess what I'm doing? You can judge me all you want but come this Saturday he's going to be sitting at the bar all alone and then when he inevitably texts me to come comfort him I'm going to tell him I know he's cheating and to never talk to me again.",2,2
795,729,"I lived in a corrupt and under-developed country for the past 28 years, and I taught myself how to code because making games is my dream job. After 7 years of learning and working online with various clients from all over the world from my home in a country that is not even listed in the Playstation Store, I finally got a full time job as a senior game programmer in one of the biggest game companies in the world. 

I got hired 3 months ago, I was literally shaking during the interview, and up until last week I was still in disbelief, and couldn't process what happened, and just kept telling myself that it's too good to be true. 

Skip forward to today, and I cannot describe how happy I am, for years now I always thought that I am not ""that good"" and the jobs I've been having are coincidental or I just got lucky, until last week when our studio-head (my direct boss) perfectly explained to me that I am REALLY good at what I am doing, and if i wasn't then they wouldn't even hire me, let alone pay me this high, nor give me an amazing bonus deal, and most importantly they won't waste time at all relocating me to one of my favorite cities in the world (Barcelona!), also he made me discover ""The imposter syndrome"" which is crazy how familiar it feels when I read about it.",3,3
796,741,"I have red hair and have been bullied for it for a long time and was never sure about myself as a kid. Over covid I let my hair grow out and I went up in height and all. So you could say I had a little bit of a glowup, and I am finally proud of my appearance. 

So yesterday there was this party at my college and I was partying with my friends. There were some girls with us, because one of my friends is in love with one of them and for me it was the first time meeting them. 

This happened often throughout my life that for some reason people want to touch my hair, because I am a ginger. I don't mind it and find it quite funny, so one of the girls asked me if she could touch it and I said sure why not. 

Then she gave me some compliments about my hair color and that it fits great on me with my hairstyle. She also asked if it was my real haircolor (which it is) and said it looked perfect on me. 

This might sound stupid and I know. But I really feel great and have been thinking about this the whole day and this will probably stay with me for a very long time. Because it was someone who I barely knew and was a girl the same age as me. 

I am a very social person and I just can't stop thinking about how nice it was that she said that.",2,2
797,742,"I accidentally put something heavy on my glasses as they were resting on a table, and immediately retrieved them. The lenses were fine, but one of the two legs was bent upward at a weird angle. I could barely wear them. The leg was no longer fitting correctly over the ear. 

I took them to the shop where I'd bought them years ago, and they put it into their specialized machine and tried to bend it back into place. However, they said the frame was titanium, and so it usually ""springs back"" into its original shape. Meaning I had probably caused it to permanently deform, and it's trying to ""spring back"" into its deformed state now. 

I took the glasses back home and decided I would try it out with my own toolkit. I got two needle nosed pliers, and used one to hold the frame beside the lens, and one to hold the base of the leg. And I was able, very slowly, to bend the leg back more or less into place. 

There are a few tiny scratches on the lens at the corner, which can't be helped, but my glasses fit on my face again! For somebody who's not at all handy, I was pleased.",2,2
798,743,"I attended an all-week event in another country. I didn't bring any friends but that's perfectly fine. I got along with the other attendees extremely well and I think I actually found 2 new friends. Everybody's so nice and inspired and driven by similar things as I am. My interests, taste in music, and spirituality are very niche and while I do get to share some of it with the people close to me, I feel like they don't quite get me in that regard. But the people I met last week do to an extent that nobody else has. 

Everybody was being their weird self, shared their knowledge and experiences and I also got to experience awesome things that I think will stick with me for a long time. Honestly, I haven't been this happy in a very long time. Being away from my home and the people close to me was intimidating, but when I was there, I felt in my heart that there was nothing to worry about. And there wasn't. Everything just kind of sorted itself out. 

It was so freeing to be able to express myself in any and every way I felt like at the moment. And I got some very special things to take home with me to remind me of the great time I had and to bring with me when I return. I can't wait for that!",3,3
799,746,"I got my first A in a math course. I have a diagnosed and pretty significant learning disorder in math called Dyscalculia. I am 21 and struggle with not only traditional math but also concepts like time, money, clocks, and cardinal directions. Ever since I was in school, I was left behind. Teachers gave up on me by 3rd grade but I was still never put in special ed classes. I grew up humiliated in myself and sometimes even teased by others. 

I had a firm belief that I could not do math no matter what. I flunked out of my most recent math course. I've been in college for a couple years and have only taken remedial. I emailed the dean begging to get into a normal college level class and they agreed. Determined not to make myself look bad, I studied. Not well, but I studied. 

I had to teach myself how to control the anxiety that came from learning math and trying to prepare for exams. I saw a tutor despite being embarrassed for needing a calculator. I ended up with an A. 

This comes at an extraordinarily important time for me. I was at crossroads between wanting to give up on college (which caused depression) and wanting so badly to prove that I could do this (which caused anxiety). My parents seemed to be losing faith and that just made me want it more. I may have a ways to go in terms of learning discipline and how to study, but I am very happy today that I went from Ds and Fs to an A.",3,3
800,748,"I started talking to a guy that I've always noticed and got along outstandingly with, and I realized that I might have been stifling feelings for him this entire time because I really just haven't been in the best situation recently. 

But we really started talking, like really talking about our lives and future plans. This was two days ago, and then at the end of the day (we had been talking on snapchat,) he put a little thing on the bottom of his snap that said ""I think you're cute"" but in german so naturally I was like ""I think you're cute too,"" and we talked until 12 that night. I woke up to a good morning from him. 

Once we both had free time that day we just talked and I couldn't help but fall for him a little bit more. We were talking earlier, too, just about the small things: my dad passed away recently, his service is tomorrow, and the guy is going through some rough stuff in his family right now, so I just tried to make him feel better. 

and then he said he thought he was in love with me. I said that I really liked him too! but I think we have issues with ourselves we really need to work out before we can pursue something like that. I adore him, though, and I really hope I didn't mess anything up. 

We agreed to just be there for each other, to be friends as best we could, and just go from there in life. I don't know him very well yet so I really respect that decision and frankly, I'm just excited! This is the first serious thing I've had with a guy. 

In any case, I'm just happy that I have someone like him in my life if we end up as friends or something else.",3,3
801,753,"My depression has been very heavy recently, especially so due to the pandemic and my country going back into a state of emergency. I'm not in school currently and my work is closed because of the lockdown so I've spent the past two weeks in bed, bored out of my mind. 

Today was completely different! I was called in for a shift at work (I work at a bookstore) as we're permitted to be open for curb side pickup. Even though i wasn't working with my favourite co-worker, I still had some co-workers I really liked in and my entire seven-hour shift consisted of us messing around whilst still getting our work done. We were receiving shipments of new product while listening to the hamilton soundtrack and catching up after not seeing each other in a while. It was so much fun to be around people again after having virtually zero social interaction since the new year. 

My manager bought us all McDonald's and I got to wander the empty mall during my break which was really nice too. After work I expected to go home and go back to what I had been doing for the past two weeks, but my sister bought me taco bell and asked me if I wanted to play beat saber together on my vr headset. I wasn't really feeling up to it after such a long day at work, but I agreed to play for a bit because I had nothing better to do. I am so glad I did. 

We had so much fun, unarguably the best night since quarantine began. We ended up playing until my headset died and then switched over to singing karaoke together for another couple hours. I was exhausted and sweaty by the end of it all, but the smile I have on my face thinking about how good today was is unreal. 

When it feels like youre drowning in your depression, wasting away your life doing nothing, having a good and productive day like this is absolutely wonderful.",3,3

I am happy because my birthday is coming up quickly, and something is telling me it's gonna be one of the best ones. I am pursuing a dream in college, which I never thought I'd do. 

I have a handsome man at my side who supports me and loves me the way I am, even after he's seen me throw up from food poisoning in his toilet. I am happy because I'm finally updating my wardrobe to some high quality clothes that I really like and that make me feel confident as a woman. I am happy that I made my customers laugh today in the store, and I anticipate the arrival of some regulars because they are a joy to work with. 

I am happy because I finally know what to get my dad for Father's day that he's guaranteed to like. I'm happy to have my favorite animal crossing villager on my island. Between rough weeks and world news, it's hard to keep my blessings in mind. 

Things I look forward to, little and big things, things that may fade in a year but will leave the taste of happiness in my mouth after it departs. I feel as if I am blooming with the flowers despite the pollution around me. Today I am happy because I found my blessings again.",3,3
803,758,"We drove for about an hour to get to the tree farm, walked around, and found the PERFECT tree. There's always some bad trees, some good trees, too tall or too short, but there's the perfect tree. My grandma likes a certain type of pine, six feet tall, flat on one side, semi-sparse but thick branches, and a beautiful frosty teal colour. Of course, after about 15 minutes of walking around I heard her shout ""It's here!' and walked over to see the PERFECT tree. 

It was so fun to drive her around afterwards with the tree tied to the top of the car, everywhere we went she would tell people how we found the perfect tree and she was so happy. It's awesome. I've already received several pictures of it through her decorating process that she's excitedly texting me. 

I don't really celebrate Christmas so I don't have a big tree to set up, but I LOVE getting those texts. Seeing others happy for the holidays is all I need. 

I'm also happy because I ordered Chinese food for dinner tonight. I have an eating disorder and haven't had this meal in about 1.5 years so this is sort of terrifying. It's not a special occasion, and I don't feel like I deserve it, but I'm doing it anyways. 

I'm trying to be easy on myself and let myself have nice things. And I'm going to hold onto this feeling of excitement for my favourite dish instead of the feeling of fear.",3,3
804,761,"Today was my first small victory against my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. One of my fears relating to OCD is fear of contamination from various chemicals, including cleaning supplies such as bleach. 

Even if I don't get in direct contact with a chemical and I just touch the container I get incredibly anxious, so I start to obsessively wash my hands to try and ensure nothing bad happens to me. And even after washing my hands I would still continue to be anxious for hours or days on end. 

I started therapy a few months back, and a part of OCD treatment is exposing yourself to your fears, so my therapist asked me to touch the bleach bottle every day and not wash my hands for at least an hour. 

This has been incredibly hard for me, it made me very anxious and after the hour had passed I would go and immediately wash my hands. But not today! Today I touched the bleach bottle, tried to distract myself with something and it worked! I completely forgot about it and the day passed without me being anxious or running to wash my hands as I would usually do. 

For the first time in a long time I am feeling hopeful and positive that I can live a normal life.",3,3
805,766,"Usually if I see a homeless person, I'll stop by the closest fast food joint and pick them up a meal or something and then continue on my way home. I know most people are skeptical of that kind of thing but my rule of thumb is I'd rather get scammed out of a $10-15 meal then let someone go without a meal if I have the means to help. 

So yesterday I was driving home from work and I see the woman holding a sign saying she recently lost her job and anything would help. A few feet away were her kids, ranging from around six to around 16. I did my usual and picked up some fast food. I spent a little more than usual because of the kids, around $30 total. 

When I dropped it off, she gave me the biggest, happiest smile I have ever seen. All I did was give her and her kids some chicken and soda but she was so grateful for just that. I've never seen someone's eyes light up the way hers did when I handed her that food. 

It really made me think how lucky I am. I mean I complain about my parents like every teen does but these kids had been sitting in the sun for at least a couple hours and were just so appreciative for two meals to share. I thought I was helping them out but they're the ones who helped me by showing how it's the little things we need to be grateful for.",3,3
806,77,"I've been hearing a lot of people saying that MIT students aren't successful as Stanford or Harvard students because there aren't as many well-known MIT CEOs. It seems rather unfair of them to say that because MIT students have contributed a lot to this world from nobel-prize winning theorems to groundbreaking algorithms. 

Also there are lot of MIT grads like David Siegel who went on to found great companies that don't necessarily have a face to the brand like Jobs' Apple or Zuckerberg's Facebook. And on top of that, there many of MIT grads who go on to be CTOs or other types of product managers (sorry for the emphasis on course 6), and without them, the companies would not be the same. 

Above all, out of the ""top"" institutions, MIT does the most to help lower-income students attain social and economic mobility (I remember reading an article, but can't find the link). 

This is not to say that MIT doesn't have problems, but at the end of the day, I wish people didn't equate fame/status with success. You don't have to be a famous CEO or a CEO in general to be successful. And I'm sure a lot of the people I mentioned didn't end up becoming crazy famous because they value privacy, which is fine! 

And a lot of alumns end up doing what they're interested in regardless of status, which is amazing and also indicative of success! Success can look different for people.",1,1
807,773,"Scroling through Instagram has been a part of my daily routine since maybe 8th grade. Now with quarantine I had found myself just scrolling and opening and closing the app habitually. All day every day for the past two-three months. It was honestly starting to fry my brain a bit. It also was making my self esteem really low and made me feel lonely. I'd see people get all these likes and comments and showing throwbacks of hanging with their friends before quarantine. 

Beforehand, when I was able to live my life and was only on the app for maybe 2 hours combined throughout the day, I hardly gave it thought. But now it just nags at me and I find myself stalking my ex or my boyfriend's ex or random girls who seem popular and naturally photogenic. It made me feel low and stupid for being so caught up on it. 

So I decided to just delete the app for about a month. Maybe even longer if I feel better off. It was just generally distracting me and had no sustenance in it aside from constant memes and people posting their best selves. I've been on reddit more and it's a lot more positive with more information and things to explore. 

So far I'm happy to be able to cut something that kind of is my generation's mental crack. My self esteem is going back up and my mind doesn't feel so hooked on just looking for social validation and something to consume. First day I deleted it, I kept tapping my phone where the app used to be and it's insane how it wires your brain. 

Now I've been watching more movies, going on walks, journaling more, and even made fried chicken today. Not saying Instagram is like this heroin for the mind but it was an app that really just sucked my brain cells away because I simply allowed it and didn't have the self control. Now I'm just glad to be able to step back.",3,3
808,774,"Since I was a kid, I was just seeking to be free. I grew up in the type of home where you didnt want your mom to come home. I want to be free to live my life without fear or being manipulated. 

When I became an adult, my depression made working feel impossible. I was chronically in low income housing or living with strange roommates under strange conditions. For the last few years, I worked in a toxic work environment with a narcissist boss. 

The only things that would remind me to be thankful I'm alive with food on the table was the emotional support cat I found and my partner. We were so stressed that sometimes it didn't even feel like we were a romantic couple. 

Then we made a plan to break out of the cycle we found ourselves in. We managed to save enough for me to get treatment for my depression. I found a remote job that has basic, simple responsibilities so it's easy for me to handle and I can get depression treatments and see my doctors (and live a life, eat regular meals, workout, and get enough sleep) during the day. 

I no longer have to take out predatory loans or beg manipulative people for money to pay my bills. And then today we moved out of our crappy living situation to our own place that we love! 

And I just had to go to the bathroom and cry an ugly cry because I think I finally achieved what I was trying so hard to achieve since I was a kid. And it was so simple. It wasn't some crazy, unknown plan that required stumbling on services we didn't know about and being free of toxic influences that would prevent us from using them. I feel like I can FINALLY LIVE LIFE for the first time in my life.",3,3
809,776,"I recently decided to make some big changes to my lifestyle after being diagnosed with bulging discs in January. I realized I needed to shed some weight and be a lot more active. I have also started a treatment for my chronic illness in the last 6 months that has been life changing. I have been seriously unwell for 6 years with chronic daily migraine, cluster headaches and neuralgia. I became unwell at the age of 19 and now at 26 I have found a treatment that is working amazingly and I am becoming the vibrant person I used to be. I am still in pain everyday but it's so much more manageable now and I am able to do things I thought I would never be able to do again. 

Since January I have gone from a completely sedentary lifestyle with a LOT of emotional eating to someone who walks 7000 steps a day and works out 3 times a week. I have been in a calorie deficit for the past month and today I found that I have lost half a stone, lost 4 inches off my waist and 2.5 off my hips! I am so happy with my progress and even happier that I am able to combat my emotional eating binges. I have so much more energy now and I am so much happier in myself too. 

Earlier this month I also felt far enough into my recovery to begin to look for employment again after not being able to work for 4 years. I applied to a few jobs in the health sector and found out today that I have an interview next month to be a Medical Secretary! I cannot describe how delighted I am that I even got an interview. If I were to be successful and get the job it would be life changing for me and my family. I am so nervous but also so excited for the future. 

In less than a year my life has changed so much. I was in pain everyday unable to even get out of bed most days wishing that I would just die in my sleep. Now I am active, healthy, losing weight, in a loving relationship and have employment prospects! 2020 me wouldnt recognize 2021 me in a million years. I am so proud of myself.",3,3
810,785,"Earlier this week I broke my stale routine. I went to the local bagel shop for breakfast. I could tell the girl behind the counter was smiling at me and when I went to tell her my name for the order she told me she already knew it from the last time I was there. That put me in a really good mood. 

I just started a new job, and while I'm working remotely the job I just left was also remote since March (due to COVID). The isolation has been weighing on me and while I'm usually feeling down about it this last week I've been in a great mood. 

A couple days ago I finally went into my new office yesterday and this girl in my office texted me to let me know she would meet me to show me around the building and get my access cards and things. When I arrived and I met her I realized that she is drop dead gorgeous, 100% my type: tall, slender, brunette, and around my age (late twenties). She seemed really nice and I was still in a great mood so I teased her a bit. She reciprocated in a witty way and we generally both seemed to enjoy the interaction. 

Yesterday I got a text that just said: What are you doing tonight? The rest of the day flew by and we went and got drinks at a local bar. It was a fantastic time, she's really easy to get along with and she kissed my cheek as we walked to her place. 

I'm meeting her again tomorrow for dinner. It's nice to be breaking the monotony of being at home all the time and also to feel the joy of dating again. I didn't realize how isolated I was feeling lately, but this has been a great week.",3,3
811,786,"I moved out from my dad's place because I couldn't bear it anymore. The people from my workplace helped me. I was allowed to stay in the hotel I work in until I find a flat for myself to live in. They picked me up and without telling my dad that or where I was going, I left. 2 days ago I moved out from the hotel and I moved into the new flat. 

I'm so thankful for their support that I never expected from them. When we got the last things from my dad's place a couple of days ago, I forgave him for all the horrible things he had done, told him he would always be my dad, and hugged him. At the end he was a product of his parents' upbringing too, I think. He had it even harder than me as a child. It was a difficult thing to do, but I think that that is the right decision in the long run. 

I'm happy but I'm also a little bit scared to be honest. I'm 18 and this is my first time moving alone, but I'm sure it will work out eventually. I just need some time to get all set up in the new flat. Currently there's still boxes with stuff standing around that need to be emptied and lots of things that need to be tidied and set up. 

I'm mostly looking forward to making everything like I want it, and not like my dad wants it and to make it nice for myself. I have a train station, multiple grocery stores and a barber in walking distance, tomorrow the internet guy will come so I can finally start gaming again after almost 2 months without it. 

My brother came back from Africa today (he was traveling and visiting a friend there for 5 weeks) and he called me to say that he will come visit me soon.",3,3
812,787,"I am an in-home caretaker for anyone who contacts the company I work through. The man I take care of was born in the late 1930s and he has Alzheimer's. He forgets stuff real quick unless it's repetitive. For example, I taught him how to play Connect 4 because we play it nearly every day. It started as muscle memory but now he's pretty good at that game. 

Today I was doing my usual morning things, cooking him food, cleaning up his bedroom and changing his bed sheets. I hear his phone ring and him answer it. He has family that calls so I went on with my chores. 

I'm supposed to wear a name tag but I stopped due to me seeing him 5 days a week, and I didn't want to break it because I kept bumping it and ripping it off accidentally, and he said he didn't mind. My name is a unique one, and a little hard to pronounce if you have never heard it before. 

As I'm finishing up making his bed, I hear him stop talking and then shout from across the house my name, but not the right pronunciation and I bust into a toothy grin. This man is a total sweetheart and doesn't remember names or anything well and he remembered mine. 

His relative needed me to answer a simple question for her and that was it. I've been thinking about it all day, I never thought he'd get it due to it not coming up often and me not wearing my tag anymore.",2,2
813,790,"Today I was working my evening shift and I got an extra large pizza delivered at my work for me and all of my co-workers to have something to eat. About 7:00 p.m. this woman came in and she had gotten two donuts. I saw her digging through her bag for change to pay me with. She had enough change to get the two donuts. She went and sat down to eat her donuts. She looked homeless. 

Something in me told me she was hungry and I remembered there was pizza leftover in the break room. I told my coworker that I wanted to ask her if she wanted some pizza but I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. My coworker just said ask her if she's hungry. So I went and asked her if she wanted some leftover pizza I had bought earlier for lunch. She said that she would love some pizza so I went and got her some and warmed it up in the microwave. 

I brought the pizza out to her and she thanked me. Then I just continued working and finishing the things I needed to before my shift ended. Around 8:00 I started cleaning the grill at my workplace. I turned around to grab a rag and the woman I gave the pizza too was standing there. 

She explained to me that she hadn't eaten in a few days and thanked me again and told me that if I give her a rag that she would go clean the bathrooms for me. I wanted to just hug this woman at this point beacuse she was willing to go clean a dirty bathroom for some food. I explained to her that it was my job to do that and that the only thing she needed to do was to take care of herself and stay safe out in the world. 

This took me off guard today because this woman was hungry. I gave her food and she was trying to do something in return when she didn't have to. I also told her that she needed to stay warm out there because it's getting cold. Before she left she thanked me again and told me that it was kind of me to give her food and how much she appreciated it. 

Strangers can make us realize how blessed we are when we can't see it ourselves.",2,2
814,793,"He's usually a goof and not very serious. We're both pretty independent and enjoy both our time together and our time alone. He's not wildly romantic or anything, he has his moments though, and I cherish every one of them. I'm not a fan of Valentine's, never really was. I don't mind other people doing stuff for Valentine's, everyone can do what they want, but I'm pretty poor and I never felt like I needed a specific day of the year to show my love, I can do it any day of the year. 

We have been together for 7 years and we've never really done anything on Valentine's. However, he knows that I love celebrating Cheap Chocolate Day and spending like 20$ on half a cart full of cholcate to last me until Halloween. I usually go out by myself because I always figured he wouldn't wanna go. 

All yesterday my boyfriend was sick. He didn't have a fever and it wasn't like hospital levels of sick, but he was sick nonetheless. Last night I mentioned I was setting an alarm so I could hit up Walmart early and grab some candy and also some meds for him if he was still feeling sick when he woke up. 

He looks at me and says ""You better wake me up too."" I asked why? He was sick and probably needed the sleep. ""Because it's your thing, you don't do Valentine's so I want to do this with you. It makes you happy and I want to be a part of it"" I nearly cried. 

He hates going to the store unless its for a big shopping trip once a month and sometimes he even just asks me to do it because the crowds will be too much. He's got social anxiety and stuff like going to Walmart is a bit of a struggle. 

But this morning my alarm went off, and I gently tapped him awake. He woke up and got ready and we went out and enjoyed loading up the cart! He's such a sweetie, he doesn't show it super often but when he does it never fails to give me butterflies.",3,3
815,796,"I've been in a bad way for a while. Progressively worse lately. Depressed, stressed to the point of breaking, feeling lost and more hopeless than I've been in ages. 

But today I woke up, went to a spa and got a massage - a birthday present to myself to hopefully ease over sore muscles. 

In the quiet, my mind would typically wander to every way I've messed up in the last few years, things I've already messed up for the future, overthinking and overanalyzing everything I've ever done or will do. 

Instead, I forced my mind to build this whole ridiculous scenario about what was happening and why I was there, like I was reading or living in some kind of story. My mind did wander to stressful stuff some, but I would scold myself and repeat the story building in my mind. 

So, instead of laying in bed all day, going over and over the things that have been weighing on me heavily lately like I have been, I took a step out of my brain and simply allowed myself to relax, even if I had to focus on it a little. 

My body feels more relaxed, my neck isn't nearly as stiff and has probably popped 20 times since I left, and I don't feel like I'm going to suffocate in the silence tonight. 

For however long this lighter feeling lasts, I have to call this a win.",3,3
816,799,"Where I live there is one really busy intersection that always has at least two homeless people combing it for food and stuff, and most of them you can tell are fakers looking for money and pity (dogs, phones, new clothes). But today was different. 

This guy was obviously in pain. He was hunched over a little bit, and limped really slowly. He looked pretty elderly, and when he spoke, it was very heavy and slow, as if it was a task. 

I always have food on me specifically because I feel bad for the homeless there, and today I had two fig bars. The car in front of me gave him a pastry, and you could tell he was pretty happy. 

He sign was pretty beat up, and all I could read was ""hungry"", so I gave him one of my fig bars. He noticed what it was and he perked up and began thanking me over and over, saying that pastries and fig bars were ""his favorite thing in the whole world"" and so I gave him the other one I had, and he looked at me as if he couldn't believe it. 

He said ""Thank you so much man, I love fig bars. You have a blessed day, God bless you"" and I got chills because he was so genuine and grateful. It made me so happy knowing that I had given someone who had nothing their favorite thing in the whole world!",3,3
817,800,"I had a presentation to do today, and I hate public speaking with a passion. I think I did well, but it still was nerve-wracking. I ended up going to the dollar store with my mom after class, and there was this very kind cashier there. I wanted to make her happy, because that makes me happy (and I needed it after today) and because she seemed so sweet, I asked her what her favorite chocolate bar was ""because I wasn't sure what to get."" 

She said Wunderbar, so I went and got 2. I told her no bag. She asked if I wanted a receipt, so I said no thanks, and slid one of the Wunderbars across the counter towards her and said, ""and you can have one."" 

Her face instantly lit up even behind her mask and she was so thankful. It cost me $0.82 to make someone happy for a day and that just made my entire day better. Everything I did today, including the presentation, led me to meeting this kind woman and giving her a smile (and a Wunderbar). 

It just feels great. I hope she enjoyed her chocolate. It really made me feel good seeing her eyes light up like that!",3,3
818,802,"I have been having a difficult couple of years. About two years ago within the span of three months and all in my small immediate family we had a suicide, near fatal heart attack along with several follow up surgeries and two near fatal overdoses. 

About two years ago I suffered a severe concussion but have managed to acquire 3 associate degrees, though it was not intentionally. I just have varied interests and love to learn. I also won a focus award and was a director of a club at my school. Along with working part time and helping on a family farm because of the reasons aforementioned. 

I found out today that I not only got into the joint bachelors/masters program at my first choice university, which is also in the top 5% of colleges in my country, but they offered me a scholarship as well! 

I have never been proud of myself for anything I have done, but today I am happy because I have finally done something that I can truly say was on my own. My family members would degrade me or claim credit for and blow off my accomplishments, or just plain ignore me. 

The real work starts in the fall, but right now I am riding this high!",3,3
819,805,"Today I decided to visit friv. Now it's bad. So I searched 'Friv old'. It led me to frivold.menu. After being bombarded with fake ads, the site warned me that my browser cannot have flash so I would be stuck with emulators. The warning, when clicked on, led me to a .zip download, containing a browser which can still get the flash player original plugin, the unity web player and the Adobe flash player. 

So I downloaded the .zip file and extracted it. I have a really annoying antivirus which quarantines suspicious things so I wasn't concerned about if it was a virus. Then I ran the browser installer. Flawless installation. I ran the unity web player installer. Flawless installation. 

And it was time to download flash. I expected nothing but disappointment. I expected that horrifying error, saying that the installer couldn't find the plugin directory for the browser. Surprisingly, I did not see it. At this point I'm like ""Cool, cool. But there WILL be something wrong down the line"". There wasn't. 

I opened up the browser. It WORKED!!! I AM PLAYING THE LEGARY TROPHY GAME FROM A DECADE AGO LIKE ADOBE NEVER RIPPED AWAY OUR SMALL JOY! I was at the verge of literal tears now. 

I had never beaten it because I was too young to understand the tasks. I never got my closure. Today, I beat it! When I beat it, it said the site where it came from. I visited it and it's still up, filled with flash games! WHICH I CAN NOW PLAY WITH LITERALLY NO HICCUPS!!! I am so grateful. 

I have now secured the holy .zip in my drive. I hope that it never gets deleted and I will be able to share this joy with my child, if I am lucky enough to have one. Because no one should go through modern life without experiencing the true joy of the good old flash games.",3,3
820,812,"I moved colleges about 2 years ago because of the toxic friends I had at the time and due to the location of the new college I moved to most of the friends I made there were long distances away so I was unable to see them outside of classes and partly due to being scared of getting into a toxic friendship again. 

Recently I just moved to a college close to me and now can easily hang out with people due to the fact most of the people are either in my town or just in the next town over. So after 2 years I finally have the chance to hang out with friends after classes. 

My friend invited me out today as they live in the same town as me and was already planning on hanging out with another so of course I agreed. They are both really nice people so I wasn't too worried something bad would happen. Everything was great and after we hung out, I'm at home and go to tell my dad and mum goodnight as it's a daily thing I do. 

My dad says, ""It's nice to see you hanging out with friends today"" and it caught me by surprise as my dad is a man who doesn't show much emotion unless something crazy has happened. He was genuinely happy when he said it too. So that is why I am happy today.",2,2
821,815,"I went on such a great date yesterday. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2.5yrs. During that time we were long distance (2hrs away) because I was at college. He would always come up and stay at my place for the weekend and we would plan a date out together (same if I came down to visit him). I never minded this because I like making sure whatever we do we both liked or were up to trying and he likes to bounce off ideas together. 

I recently graduated and moved back to the same hometown and we get to spend more time together now. I texted him asking if he could plan out a date because I've been busy trying to get ready for a new job and I just wanted to be surprised. A few days later my boyfriend tells me the date/time and to dress extra nice. I was excited and got dressed up in a dress and everything. He picked me up and gave me flowers, first to the movies, next we went to a fancy restaurant for dinner, then walked around talking and goofing off. 

This may sound like a normal date but something about not knowing and just getting dressed up made me really happy. Neither of us knew the movie and it was surprisingly good. The restaurant was amazing too. I'm definitely going back again. Especially where it was located it's a romantic place to walk at night and just look at the night sky. 

I loved the date and it made me so happy how he planned it and just made me feel really special. He knows I'm not great at keeping secrets so he knows I'm planning a surprise date for him now too. I'm getting all giggly planning.",3,3
822,817,"I started studying for my bachelor's degree some three years ago, and the amount of pressure at my university gave me serious mental health issues - I started to have a whole lot of breakdowns and later got diagnosed with depression. I got expelled then after my first semester, but entered the same uni last year to once again major in English philology. 

Now, in February or so my mental issues got worse and I started skipping classes a lot, and when the whole distance learning thing began I finally understood that right now I am not ready for higher education, and that it is not healthy for me. While the decision to have a break for an unspecified amount of time was perfectly conscious, my parents were not willing to accept it and demanded that I go on, so I had no choice but to sabotage my own studies and fail just enough classes so I could get expelled. 

And it worked! I saw an email today saying that I should collect my papers. The best thing? My mother asked me to sit down for a little chat and said a bit begrudgingly but still with a smile ""So, I reckon, you wanted this to happen and it did? Well, I'm a bit upset about all the work that was in vain, but I'm not gonna live your life for you, and this is your decision. I support you no matter what.""",3,3
823,821,"My cat is, by now, about 11 years old. A senior. He has lived with my mom since I moved out until half a year ago, when I was finally able to take him in with me. I usually do not think of him as my baby or play thing. He is a pet I dearly love, but a pet. And he is a cat and cats are independent beings, which enjoy or tolerate company. I am proud he enjoys my company and likes to cuddle! 

But yesterday was more. I opened the door for him to go out and he stayed around. I sat down for cuddles and after a few minutes he started to move away. But when I got up and tried to go inside he meowed and clearly wanted to show me something. 

I followed him and he started moving through the streets, making sure I stayed close and he did not lose me. He marked his territory by rubbing and meowed when I stayed too far back or did not go through the neighbors' gardens, but came back for me. 

It was amazing that he apparently really wanted me to be with him on this stroll and I am really proud! This is untypical for cats, he must really like me and from now on I consider myself a cat in training!",2,2
824,822,"Today I am happy because I was thinking about things that I have done, whether that be mistakes I've made, things I have said or done that I should not have, and I felt very embarrassed. 

I know that sounds like I shouldn't be happy, but the way I look at it I am very happy that I am able to look back on certain actions and behaviors in my past and be embarrassed or ashamed of that because it means I have grown - even just a teeny bit! 

Personal development has always been an important value of mine and I always try to be better than I was before. So it makes me happy to know I am in a place where I can acknowledge certain things were mistakes or were not worth it at the time, that sort of thing, and know that I am not that person anymore and I am even just one step closer to becoming the woman I am meant to be. 

I hope everyone can look back on certain times in their life and remember that even if you feel embarrassed or regret something, at least you know that you are no longer like that.",3,3
825,824,"It's been months. The last time I remember having my jeans is around Easter time and then they just dropped off the grid. My first fear was they had been swallowed by the washing machine and were now in the sock afterlife. But more realistically, I thought they'd been stolen by my sister. We both have similar light blue jeans. She got her pair first when she was at university, so I didn't know she had them when I bought a similar pair. 

We've been dealing with having the same jeans that keep coming out of the wash for a couple of years. Just after Easter, my pair went missing. I mentioned to my sister if she'd accidentally taken my jeans from the wash. She said she hadn't, and showed me the pair that she had in her wardrobe. 

I have other pairs of jeans so I wasn't actively looking for it out of necessity, and I was stressed with my exams so didn't think about it so much. And now it's been a long time since I've thought about those jeans. Until I was collecting my laundry and found a pair of light blue jeans and remembered my old jeans. So I took them into my sister's room thinking I'll find them in her wardrobe. I was pretty sure the pair I was holding were her pair not mine, though. 

And there she was, sitting at her desk, wearing a pair of light blue jeans. We both just laughed. And she said that she had been thinking the laundry was being washed and dried quite quickly. 

I am going to do some sort of embroidery on mine so this does not happen again. But I have my jeans back and I am happy!",2,2
826,825,"I used to play a lot of online shooters and also Eve online maybe 10 years ago or more. At the time it was just normal and I didn't interact that much, let alone thank anyone for their time and for spending the match with me. 

Due to life stuff I rarely can play online since I will get interrupted often or need to go do something else, but when I have the beautiful and rare thing that is an hour to myself, I will play a couple of matches of Killing Floor 2. 

The game encourages sharing resources since it's in your interest for your team to survive, so I often share and bring people's dropped weapons back to spawn for them if they die, and find this brings me enjoyment if I can be that one guy that helped someone out. Also if you have a higher level then your perks make the game easier for you, so you can give your cash to another player who is struggling and tough it out with a pistol for another round or two. 

I have found that I appreciate this golden time so much that I genuinely feel thankful to the other players for spending their time with me and (usually) their good sportsmanship, so I decided to always make sure to say so at the end of a match. This makes me happy and sometimes I get a nice response too. It's nice to spread the appreciation.",2,2
827,828,"We live in Canada and sometimes the winters can get long. November is gloomy. December is usually cheerful just because of the holidays, good food, and people, and then it drags out with freezing temperatures, dark nights, and crappy driving conditions from January through April. I find I get sad around February since I'm just wishing for sunlight and for my face not to hurt when I go outside. 

We finally got a huge dump of snow and my husband and I picked up our season passes and went snowboarding for the first time. Did I fall an insane amount? Yes. Were some of my wipeouts spectacular? Absolutely. Do I know what I'm doing? Not particularly. Am I in pain? My butt is so bruised I'm looking like a plum. But man did we have fun. 

When I first brought it up in October my husband said he wanted to go with me and I was thrilled. He's a bit of a homebody in the winter so I was just excited to be able to share a sport with him. We bought all of our gear without even having tried the sport and just waited for the perfect time to go. 

We had so much fun and I'm really looking forward to hitting the hills tomorrow and again later this week too! I get to spend quality time with him, we're being active, we're learning something new together, and we're spending time outdoors - it's the best of all the worlds combined. 

It's making the winter seem so much shorter since I'm actually wishing for winter to stay and more snow to hit. It really helped changed my attitude on winter.",3,3
828,84,"I know there are a lot of negative experiences for people especially those struggling with mental health issues. Though, I do not want to scare people away from getting help when they need it. I needed help at the beginning of freshman fall so I went to medical and they did more than enough for me. 

I genuinely look forward to seeing my psychologist and my psychiatrist is a great person too. Both continuously make the best decisions for me and I cannot thank them enough for all of their help. 

So for all the people out there who need help but aren’t because they’re worried about having a bad experience, it’s worth the risk. I really hope that those who have had bad experiences do get the help they need. 

But long story short going to medical for mental health has been great for me and, especially to the prefrosh who might be reading these, please do give them a chance. They do want what’s best for you, even if some of them aren’t the best at coming to good solutions. 

This is a really long post and realistically not coherent but I hope I got my point across. And again, to those who had bad experiences, I’m so sorry.",2,2
829,841,"I got these gloves maybe eight years ago, and I didn't really use them conscientiously so they remained in very good shape. Finally about four months ago I started hitting up the gym properly, and the gloves became very useful. 

I took good care of them, making sure to wrap my hands during exercise and then to drop desiccant packets into them to keep them from getting mouldy, and airing them out properly after exercises. 

Last week I couldn't find them, and I began to suspect I had left them at the gym. I got to the gym today and checked the Lost and Found, but they weren't there. Maybe somebody had found them and taken them, or maybe they'd been thrown away. 

I went into the gym near the punching bags and looked through all the gloves. All of them had the gym's logo on them until the end of the shelf where I found my gloves! Also, they were a bit more worn out than I imagined - I guess my exercises have been taking their toll! 

I checked inside and - yep, there were the little packets of desiccant materials inside, just like I usually leave them. I'm happy I found my gloves again. It wouldn't have been a big financial hit for me to buy new ones, but I would have been unhappy with my carelessness and waste. 

This is a minor victory today and I am grateful to the Universe for giving me this little bit of order in a chaotic life.",2,2
830,850,"I didn't get to give my friend the gifts before Christmas because we were both busy with family and stuff, and it wouldn't have been practical to give it to her in school, so I gave them to her today. This evening, after we had parted and gone home, she recorded her reaction of her opening and it was priceless! It literally made me go so soft. I love her so much!! 

She said that it was incredible how much thought I'd put into it, and the stuff I'd remembered which related to these gifts. I adore seeing her so happy. And then once wed finished talking, she called her mum to brag about me, which made me blush. 

And honestly I had so much fun wrapping/decorating/organising her present!! I really love making things, and also I knew it would make her happy!! 

Basically I painted a cardboard box white, stuffed the bottom with tissue paper, placed pink glittery tissue paper in the bottom, added a layer of pink tinsel, then placed all of her gifts neatly inside, placed her card on top, then wrapped the box in pink shiny wrapping paper with tiny pink hearts on it, then tied a metallic pink ribbon around it, topped it with a matching bow, and coiled the excess ribbon. I also tied a little white, glittery Christmas tree gift tag with her name on it to the ribbon. 

Honestly I'm so proud of how it looked!! And she said I should be too!! She was actually a little annoyed that she didn't take a picture of it before taking the gifts out, but she loved them and that's the main thing.",3,3
831,851,"I was hired at my job just over 3 months now, and didn't really start working and getting hours until mid-late April, due to some bureaucracy issues and the fact that our new contract start date was delayed. 

Since being hired, I have taken additional responsibilities and have added efficiencies for the workflow such as creating excel calculation sheets to help eliminate human error and making our forms more user-friendly (improvements which were then approved by our governing government agencies). I was not asked to do these things, yet I saw improvements to be made and wanted to make things easier for everybody. 

Despite these measurable achievements, as well as becoming a go-to person for coworker questions, and even helping train experienced coworkers on this new contract, I still experience imposter syndrome. 

So, in our handbook it says that we are to have a performance review 3-6 months after hire date. My 3 months came this month, and I reached out to my boss to get a performance review on the calendar for yesterday. 

This whole week I've been anxious. Preparing my points to request a raise, trying to figure out how much of a raise to ask for, and how to go about asking. Worrying that asking for a $5/hr raise might be too much. 

Well, I started the meeting and right off the bat, my boss says she's glad I reached out to schedule because she has been wanting to schedule with me to discuss some new positions available. She discussed the position said would like to just promote me and not have to post the job first, but has to check with HR. 

I am happy to finally have a boss that can see and acknowledge my achievements and hard work in the workplace. Unfortunately, I think my last boss really did a number on my work self-esteem.

832,852,"My Dad raised me and my 3 siblings after my alcoholic mum left us. He was running his own business, raising 4 teenagers whose mum had just left, and reestablishing a relationship with all of us in a totally different dynamic. He didn't flinch once. He cried when he told us mum had left, which means more to me every day as I get older. I can't imagine what was going through his head. He has only ever been the best presence in our lives. 

He helped me through my degree and came on his own when I graduated, he helped me learn to cook when I moved out, he helped me figure out the career I wanted and he continues to help me every day with being the best human being I can be. He is happily married now to a woman who truly loves and cares for him as much as he deserves. 

Now I have a child I am even more in awe of how well he remained calm, attentive and wise through everything. I don't know how he did it. But he did, and he has an army of people around him that know how much he did for us and how well we've all turned out because of it. 

Today I said thank you. I told him I wish I'd said it sooner and we both had a slightly awkward moment of appreciation. Later on my step mum texted me saying it meant the world to him and he grew very emotional once I left.",3,3
833,858,"I have been on a journey to get my teeth fixed for 12 years now, ever since my braces came off. Due to financials and no dental insurance, it has made the process lengthy. I also battle with GERD, which makes my teeth rot a lot quicker than they should. I'm only in my 20s and all my teeth pretty much need repairs. 

My front couple of teeth had this hideous glue residue from my braces and had actually discolored to a brown in some spots. It was very embarrassing and made me extremely self conscious. 

Dentist after dentist had told me I was an odd case and there's nothing they could to about it and it's just the way I am. Just something I have to deaI with. I was discouraged beyond belief. 

I recently got dental insurance (even though its expensive and I'm already on a tight budget) and found a new dentist. I explained my situation to him and this man is a blessing. He sat down with me and made a whole plan with me on how to fix my teeth that needed work, as well as the crud physically on my teeth. He even helped me with a financial plan.

So anyways my new job is all online work from home right now because of COVID. My new boss was nice enough to set up a team meeting on Zoom this afternoon for a couple hours so I could be introduced to my new colleagues and we could get to know each other. 

I immediately noticed that there were two beautiful women in their mid-to-late twenties on the team, and they both were smiling and asking questions to me. Once my new boss took over and started giving an overview of my new responsibilities, I got a text message from one of them (they said they got my number from the new team roster) and asked me to meet up on Wednesday night if I was free so we could talk about my new job if I had questions. 

I've never explicitly been asked out by a girl in the past, but this was a welcome dopamine boost from the drama I've been dealing with.",3,3
835,865,"I've followed every single rule through this entire thing - masks and gloves every time I went out, for essentials only. No take out/delivery. Social distanced and self isolated since March 13th. Go outside only for walking. Sanitized my apartment I can't even tell you how many times. Sanitized the community laundry room and door handles to shared spaces. Worked from home, from the floor, because I have no space. Have gotten yelled at for kindly asking that people not have 20 minute conversations in front of my window while I worked. Made sure my kid got schooled, fed and followed all guidelines as well. 

I was told that the salon would be opening with the strictest of guidelines - I really didn't believe it and almost wanted to text to make sure everything was going as they emailed it would be. And I'll be going right back to my isolation because it is still safer at home for me. 

I was not let down. Every single person, there were only 8 of us including customers and staff, were wearing masks, we were able to social distance perfectly - they even sanitized my pen, took my temperature, and did an entrance evaluation. Literally everything you could expect. I couldn't be happier. 

My hair is a mental health thing for me. I started dyeing it with turquoise streaks 2 years ago and I go about every 3-4 months to get it redone. Not a huge deal but it is the one thing I love about myself. I feel happy that I was able to beat depression just for a few hours to do something nice and take care of myself and we all did it together, safely, and I'm so proud of everyone at that salon who took this seriously and took the safety of everyone into account.",3,3
836,867,"The last few weeks of school have been super stressful, especially with finals. I go to a more pristine school, so we have to work extra hard and our finals are pretty difficult. Mornings are especially rough, but I manage to get through it. 

At first, I thought it was kind of weird. Every morning, I took the same route to school. Without fail, there would be an old lady on her back porch waving at the cars driving by. At first I thought she was mistaking our car for somebody else's, or maybe waving to somebody walking by; however, she always waved when we drove by. Sometimes she would have her husband out with her, waving at us. It honestly made my morning a lot better and improved my mood.

This morning was different. It's gonna be my last day of school tomorrow, and I'm super excited because I don't have to deal with schoolwork for two whole months. Today, when we were driving by the lady's porch, she had brought out her whole family and there was a big sign saying: ""Happy Last Week Of School!"" I don't know if it was directed towards me or somebody else, but either way it was really sweet of her to write that and made me happy. 

I hope that old lady is having a good day.",2,2
837,872,"My brother and I found a kitten in a box last night. On the box was written ""Adopt me"". The kitten is barely over 1 month old and can't survive alone outside. We can't take it in because we have a jealous, territorial cat with a weaker immune system. We fed it and kept it safe on our balcony over the night. 

We posted about it on social media and my brother went to hang out flyers in the neighbourhood in hopes to find someone who's willing to adopt it. While he was gone I was outside with the kitten, taking care of it and talking to people to find it a forever home. 

A woman stopped by to ask about the kitten so I told her the story. She said she has already 15 cats but decided not to leave this one behind and wants to adopt it. I was ecstatic asking the woman if she's serious. She said yes and took the kitten who immediately calmed down and was blinking towards me. 

I feel good about this because the woman obviously knows cats, her cats are used to others AND the kitten will have a huge family it can cuddle with.",2,2
838,874,"I remember growing up in a place that was violent and dangerous, and I knew that at a very early age. In the early 60s to mid 60s, people began experimenting with heroine. And I watched our community fall apart. 

But I went to stay with my grandparents who moved out in Long Island. I was taken out and it was so different than the South Bronx. I was able to see a totally different life, totally different lifestyle, a totally different set of beliefs about things. And it sort of allowed me to make a choice about which way do I wanna live? 

And I chose a different path. I really wanted to help my community and make a difference, I wanted to prove that there were answers and you could go in and save those folks that people had written off. They had said all these terrible things about them, and I wanted to eliminate all of that stuff. 

The first ten years I was here, no one knew anything about anything, I was working hard just trying to figure out a way to save my kids. Later, I began to wanna save my kids and my community.",3,3
839,878,"I come from farm worker parents. It wasn't until I married and I was 28 years of age that I realized that I wasn't gonna go anywhere unless I have an education. I had to turn my life around to do what I wanted to do, and what I wanted to do was be in this world of media. I went to a community college and I transferred to UCLA, and I became a writer. 

From that to what I do today, I'm an advocate. I do civil rights, specifically in media. When reporting about the Latino community, it was a crime blotter. It was Maria killed Jose because Jose molested her child and the child was doing drugs on the side. It was like that, it was terrible. 

So we formed the National Hispanic Media Coalition, because how we are perceived is always going to be the way that we are treated. If we're perceived as being the laborers out in the field and so forth, you'll be treated that way. And, we're that, but we're also a great deal more.

840,883,"The great network is a writing platform. And the way we do that, is we connect teachers in K-12 schools across the country, and their students with dedicated, personalized coaches to give students individualized feedback on their writing. 

So I had really no concept of what the great network would become. For me, I think that initially, when we did a very basic test of our service, or our product, the moment I saw that we were creating new value that didn't exist before, I just got so excited about that, that I was like this can, and should, exist, it's feasible, it's desirable, for me, I never then after that wanted to do anything else. 

I think there were things that were really hard, but I never thought that it couldn't happen, or it shouldn't happen, or something like that. I think one of the ways I've been able to keep that mindset, is by kind of boxing each challenge as it comes, and not thinking about the next ten challenges. If I thought about all of the challenges at once, I would probably be so overwhelmed as to say, let's not even start this, so I was like very comfortable with the uncertainty that I was taking on, very comfortable with the risk that I was taking on, and willing to just adapt, and change, and learn. And be comfortable that I could rise to each successive challenge as it came.",2,2
841,884,"When I was very little, my parents knew there was something going on. They saw some of the anxiety, some of the motoric skills. But they didn't realize the complexity of what dyspraxia was. I felt very isolated and very confused. 

And there were stages when I didn't want to live. I thought no one believes me, I want to end my life, I want to die. And I was very lost, very confused what I wanted to do. 

So I decided after working in a summer camp when I was around 18, I met adults from the UK, New Zealand, Australia that understood my struggles. And as I got involved and situated, I got connected to the top experts in the UK. I would literally stay at their homes and they would teach me about dyspraxia, and I just felt so proud of myself. 

For the first time I felt confident, because I met the right people and the mentors to guide me and assist me. In meeting other adults like myself, I knew through their teaching, their experience and their guidance of what I was living with. 

A, I wasn't alone and B , I had talents and gifts. I learned from some of the patients at the development how I can do things because I had people in school, 18 through 21 saying I couldn't. And now I know I can.",3,3
842,885,"I am the director of risk management at Tiffany & Co.. When I was in school, had I even thought I was interested in insurance, there weren't any programs at that point. A lot of us that are in the industry now don't have that sort of experience or schooling in our background. 

Risk management means we're responsible for insuring the assets of the company whether those are our employees, or jewelry, our property or buildings. Protecting us from the risks that are generated by the things we do in the course of our business. 

Taking jewelry out on photo shoots, our jewelry isn't just sitting in a case waiting for someone to buy it. It's working for us every day. Just by virtue of that fact, it's creating an exposure. 

Most people would think insurance is just boring and a stuffy suit type job. Yes it is the insurance industry, but I'm not living my day in an insurance policy day in and day out. It's something different everyday. 

If you're an accountant, you're doing debits and credits everyday. When I graduated, I realized I do not wanna do debits and credits everyday. So I'm very happy I found the path I did, even if it took a couple of turns to get there.",1,1
843,888,"19 years ago, I started working for SLUG Magazine. The previous owner of SLUG heard about me, and called me up and asked me to shoot a cover. That's how I first became a staff member of SLUG. From that point forward, I became a managing editor, and then two years later, I had the opportunity to take over the magazine, and that's when I officially became editor and then publisher. 

I've always felt different from my family, and from being part of the peer group I grew up in, I just always didn't quite connect. But I kind of learned to appreciate Salt Lake City for what it is, and the work here that we could do to find others that feel that way. Where they may not feel that way at home, or at school, or in a lot of other environments. 

But here in SLUG Magazine, we can really appreciate them for being different. I really love doing what I do, and hearing these stories from these individuals that come up to you and say hey, I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for my experience with SLUG Magazine, hearing that feedback and that validation from other individuals about how we've affected their lives in a positive way, that's priceless.",2,2
844,890,"We grew up kind of dysfunctional and poor, a lot of alcoholism and a lot of bad stuff in our neighborhood like drug dealing and what have you. I ended up getting pregnant really young and then getting married right after that. So I was 19, 20 but I was like, my god, I'm a teen pregnancy just like every other woman in my family. I didn't even feel bad for myself. I felt guilty for everyone else. 

So, I had started writing on the web as a house wife. I had my blog and then I started getting jobs and then finally someone else online published a book. And I was so jealous that I was like, that's it I'm giving myself a year to write a book and get it published. 

I think there's just this mind set that you're gonna do one thing and that's the thing that's going to be your career. I don't think you're gonna pick one thing right now. And that's what you better get your degree in, and that's what you better spend nine hours a day doing, or you're gonna fail. 

The only mistake you can make now is to not do anything.",2,2
845,895,"I wanted something to do, on nights and weekends. I wanted to go and use all the new technology of the day, cheap sensors and what not. So just out as a passion project, I started building interactive art. I started falling in love with engineering again. It happened when we started making interactive art together. A whole bunch of people would get together after work, couple times a month, maybe once a week, talk about all the fun things we wanted to build. 

We started making more stuff, and some of it was totally terrible, and nobody wanted to play at all. But some of it people liked. We started building more and more stuff that was completely unrelated to work and served absolutely no practical purpose in the world. We were just making technology for technology's sake. We had no idea it was art until other people started calling it art. We were like whoa. We're not artists. No way, right? 

An extension of that is, how do you reject that cultural narrative that we're all told? That you go to school, and then you go and you get a job, and you find a career, and you find a wife. There's this very specific road you're supposed to take because the reality is it's different for everybody.",2,2
846,90,"To the person who asked if anyone has gotten over depression in college and how to help a friend: It depends on the source of depression for how to get over it to be honest. My depression was caused by burnout so how I got over it was taking a medical leave to grow as a person outside of work/school. Like a lot of people who enter college, I felt like my whole life leading up to college was just obsessing over academics and people pleasing. 

My journey consisted of a ton of therapy, a cycle of self destruction and self reflection, figuring out who I want to be for myself. Usually that's something people have time for in college, but I don't find that to be true here heh. 

Anyway, even though my journey was very individual- I had to do the work on my own- I couldn't have had the capacity to do it without a support system. I think as a friend, the best thing you can do is 1. Listen and 2. Meet your friend halfway. 

What I found helpful was when my friends checked in with me but didn't press or become overbearing. They engaged and sympathized when I had things to rant about but didn't force it. They offered me their floor or shared food when they could but also kept their boundaries and limits. 

What made things worse from some people was asking me how I was doing every time they saw me and being awkward around me...like just because depressed doesn't mean I'm depressed 110% of the time, so don't act like I'm incapable of other emotions. Also obviously ditching would be bad, but no one did that to me thankfully. 

But yeah, it's not your responsibility to save your friend from depression, it's really only something they can do themselves. It's more like when someone is sick with a virus and only their immune system can fight it, but you can buy them medicine, walk with them to the doctor, and feed them snacks while you watch Netflix together yunno?",2,2

I was an athlete at one point in my life, I like sports, so let's check it out. At that point, I didn't really have much experience in photography. I realized I was kind of out of my league for their photography positions, but the door was open to be an editor. 

I immediately jumped to that job, knowing in the back of my head I wanted to be a photographer, so I just took that opportunity knowing I was eventually going to parlay it into where I wanted to go. So in my spare time I'd go out and take photos, because the thing was, working for that company allowed me the access I wanted to get to take photos at sporting events. 

I didn't think that I'd be here 25 years later still kind of doing it. The moment you capture something and you just know you've got it in your camera, it's magical. So I just walked through the doors that were opened for me, and I took them and here I am now. I'm just fortunate to do something I love, and it trips me out that I get paid for it. Doors are going to open and close, and it's going to come down to which ones you walk through.",2,2
848,901,"I'm the founder of PixelsIO, which is a company that was formed to take over some technology I created while I was a grad student at MIT. My time is consumed by that right now, but the path to getting to there was sort of all over the place. It's perfectly fine that you don't know what you wanna do right now. 

For a long time, when I was in school and earlier than that I was really obsessed with the idea of being a professor. I sort of realized a little bit later in my life that I was more obsessed about the title or the label of that job than what that job was. 

Getting to the essence of, what is it that I really liked about the professor? Was it the teaching, the other people? Was it the freedom to do research? Was it the idea that you can bring an idea to fruition? 

The thing that I focused on, and the reason why I decided not to become a professor at the end of the day and to do Pixels is because it's the fastest way, to bring your ideas into people's hands. Because no one else is gonna do it for you, so you might as well do it yourself.",1,1
849,903,"I knew I wanted to go to college but didn't know how I was gonna get there. I had a very supportive family, but financially, we didn't have any money tucked away. Fortunately, I was able to get a scholarship to a college. I got my Bachelor's degree in communication. Out of college, I did sales for a number of years just kind of trying to find my way. 

My wife was a student at Wayne Community College, and they had an opportunity, an opening on the phones. One day the chancellor of the college was on the other end and I had no clue. I was just excited to be answering phones for the college. He wanted to meet me and I had opportunities to advance from there. 

Now I am the associate vice chancellor for students services. So, I tell everybody, I'm not supposed to be here, statistically speaking. I'm a black male and I grew up in Detroit with all the gang violence, with all the drug violence.

850,906,"At UCLA I was studying molecular cell and developmental biology. After I graduated, I found a job in a biotech company. But I was bored, I was just running basic tests. I knew that deep down inside of me there was an artist, so I left my job and just really threw myself into working on my art. 

So that's when I started going more towards the route of entertainment design and being a concept artist. It's the idea of taking illustration and applying it to entertainment mediums like video games, animation, and film, in a very problem solving manner. To me, it was right up the same alley as microbiology, because it's all about problem solving. 

What I love about the work I do now is that it's a different kind of problem solving, except these are a little bit more exciting to me. Each of you has something in your gut that tells you when something is right or wrong. And I feel like it is important to listen to that. 

I guess I treated my path like an experiment. Let's do this, if it doesn't work, let's try something else. If that doesn't work, let's try one more thing. If that doesn't work, again, reassess.",2,2
851,917,"After high school, I took a complete departure and decided to move across the country. I went to the Coast Guard Academy through a prep school in New England. After a year, I totally changed my mind and then came back. That started off this whirlwind of college activity. It was probably the most tumultuous time for my parents, because I couldn't settle on a major because I wanted to do everything. 

So I went into nursing and worked at a nursing home for a while. Then I went into anthropology. Then I went into archeology. Then I kinda went back to design. I was trying to feel my way through, I wasn't sure if I wanted to do digital design or print design. So I played to my strengths, went through print. It wasn't until after college that I made the switch to web. 

But my parents were like, my God, you are all over the place. They had planned a very specific type of life out for me where they wanted me to be very successful. We want you to have a job where you get to sit down in air conditioning, and not have to deal with the deep fryer. And 110 degree heat and cooking stuff over a stove. So, there's a lot of hesitation while I'm in the process. 

But, when you're at an impasse, when you need to make a decision, think about your deathbed. It's a little morbid, but think about your deathbed. Think about all the things you would have done with your life. And would you have regretted not doing this thing? If you would have regretted not doing that thing, that's the absolute thing you should do.",2,2
852,919,"I don't think I'll ever find a job that I'm as good at as I was at being an infantry officer. I was a captain in the Marine Corps, in command of 950 marines and sailors. Every Friday I would go out to our Liberty Formation before I launched them for the weekend, and you just see this massive sea of servicemen and women that I was in command of. It was awe inspiring and humbling and it was just an awesome opportunity. 

I ended up taking a job with a medical IT company. And I was in a cubicle next to a 23 year old, looking through spreadsheets to see if there were duplicate hospitals in them. You couldn't have wasted my experience or skill sets more, but that's all part of it. 

You can not expect your first employer or the people that you're interviewing with or the community you moved to, you can't expect them to know everything about you and understand your value right off the bat. You have to go in and you've gotta show them. You've got to compete again and so I had a lot of fun figuring out how do I become a non profit leader and build a non profit? 

At the same time, I've also gotta fight these guys that wanna beat me up on national TV because that helped me pay my bills as well. So trying to juggle all those while we were having kids and everything, it was a wild, crazy transition for sure.",3,3
853,92,"I'm at the point in the semester where every class is building in both intensity and workload while I am simultaneously falling farther and farther behind, both in workload and in sleep. Whether it's lectures, problem sets, or readings, I feel like I'm constantly 3 steps behind where I should be, and because of that I just feel like a failure and imposter syndrome hits like a truck. It always hits like a truck. 

Except despite all of this, I still don't think I'd rather be anywhere else. We can all joke about wanting to drop out and run away from everything, but at the end of the day I think we all love it here. It's a community of both intense difficulty and pain, but also of immense supportiveness and success. We build each other up. That's why I love it here. 

Sure, sometimes it's 3:00am the night before a problem set is due and ""I hate this f***ing place"" is the only thing on my mind. But the next day, when it's sunny out and I turn in the problem set and I get to hang out with my friends and forget even just for a moment about the hard work behind and ahead?

854,921,"When I was a kid growing up we had a wrecking yard. So, you're naturally tied into it and of course we always had the old circle trap cars and stuff so we've always been interested in those. Then I got into drag racing. Getting into the mechanical end of things was a very strong deal because I wanted to be a pilot. And Vietnam was going real strong when I got out of high school. So I wanted to get a commission and fly. 

I had a heart arrhythmia, so they wouldn't let me do that. So if I couldn't fly, I thought, well, I'll work on them. That was a big struggle for me, not being able to pursue that end of it. But I guess I don't miss that because not a day goes by, even with this equipment out here, that I don't use stuff that I actually learned back then. 

Regardless of where you learn it, once you learn it it's there and if you're fortunate enough to retain your memory for a while. Based on the fact that I have been around this industry for a long time, and I've been an aircraft mechanic for over 40 years, if you can learn the theory of mechanics, you can do anything.

855,923,"I always had a huge love for history. I started out as a history major, but then I thought about being stuck doing historic research in a room somewhere and when I was a kid, you couldn't keep me inside. 

Archaeology appealed to me a little bit more than history did, because it meant that I could be outside. I could be the one recovering the material goods from people that really didn't have a voice in history. 

You can switch what you wanna do at any given point, and I think that there's also a lot of identity issues. That can sometimes get wrapped up in that, especially if you pick a very specific focus in whatever you're doing. 

Don't be afraid to explore who you are as a person and what you love, and if anybody pushes back against you and says that that's not possible. Because sometimes, they do it in these very, very, very innocuous way that's so subtle, you don't realize that it can actually kind of erode away at your self confidence. 

Sometimes, it's just a backhanded comment. And you don't think about how damaging those things can be.

And the next couple of years were pretty scary 'cause I had a degree in something I was pretty sure I was never gonna use. And I just kind of didn't know what course my life was go na take. 

By the time I graduated from college I actually had a few nationally-released records, and they didn't make that big of a splash or make that much money , but it was enough to get me thinking like, "" Wow, well this would be cool to do this for a living. I like this more than being an architect or hovering over a drawing board for 20 hours a day.'' 

It's a clichÃ © , but you do have to kind of follow your dreams.If I were you, I would definitely go for what makes you happy.

I could do like so many other people did, which is just move to somebody else's neighborhood, or move to a nicer neighborhood, and put on your blinders, and say everything's fine here. I decided I wanted to live in my neighborhood. 

And in order for me to do that, and to really make it a place I want to raise kids, I gotta get to work. So when I became an alderman one of the things I first noticed is that the city doesn't really take care of these neighborhoods like they need to. 

So we created this nonprofit as an organization that can deal with what is not happening in the schools. What we know is that what happens after school and on a weekend can be just as powerful as what is, or is not happening in the classroom. A lot of these kids go to really poor performing public schools, so we formed this organization to try to start providing some stability and some direction in the lives of young people. 

Too many kids over here feel abandoned by their city, and by the rest of the world, and so we're opening their eyes to a lot of what is available in their own city. And in that way too, also helping them take some ownership of their city.",2,2

Eventually, a teacher of mine at USC who goes back to when George Lucas was going to USC got me a job up at Lucasfilm. That's the kind of stuff that happens all the time. It was out of the blue. You have no idea. There's no planning. I didn't say, ""I'll go to school and then try to get a job up at Lucasfilm.'' So it didn't work out that way. 

 

So I got that opportunity and moved up here. 

 

If you're going to go into something as you start doing it, you're not as good as you are later. And you don't know how good you are at some things until you try them. So that's why you do have to be led by your passion if it's something that really intrigues you.

My mother was a writer for women's magazines, my father wrote radio plays and did television, so we all became very interested in story and narrative.

I was in the newsroom of the Washington Post all during Watergate. I was both an editor and a reporter. I was sent to Moscow at one point, for four years, as Moscow Bureau Chief, which was an extraordinary encounter with a society whose citizens were denied access to factual information. And it made it even more important to use the powers that are given to us in these open and democratic societies in a way that will inform others. 

So, what has been part of my life just started out in a certain pattern. It just stayed in that course ever since , and now I'm at NPR. What this place does, and other great icons of journalism, is the reporting of fact conveyed in a non-polemical, civil dialogue to readers, listeners, viewers, and bring to them extraordinary information they couldn't possibly have any other way.

And I've gone further in the Navy than I ever, ever fathomed, from a junior enlisted seaman to a captain in the Navy in 30 years. At each phase along the way I had to pick what is my goal here? My goal is to be the best naval flight officer or to be the best department head. 

So we need to have an internal spotlight. We need to shine a light on ourselves and go, where do I need to improve? If you're not improving then you're just not moving forward. But at the same time, you can be so critical of yourself that you're actually holding yourself back.

We're all talented. We all have special things that make us unique and we all have something to offer the world. We just gotta go out there and offer it, but you have to do it in small steps. 

So I've always been one of these people that believes that you need to be thinking about the next challenge. It's good to reflect, but you have to be moving forward.",2,2
861,94,"I wonder if I'm really cut out for science. I have the most fun writing essays in humanities classes, weaving out stories which support my thoughts on anthropology or propaganda or themes in Russian literature or the history of the radio. But when I'm supposed to write the story of some scientific research I've done, I totally blank out. 

I feel like I can't translate the things I learn to the scientific research I want to do. The more I learn and work in science, the more I feel like science isn't my thing; sure, I can do it, but it's not what I'm really meant to do. 

Maybe the only reason I went into science is because of societal and parental expectations, or the fact that science is more respected than the arts and humanities, and maybe if I was really allowed to do whatever I wanted with my life I wouldn't look twice at science. 

None of my hobbies are science related, I always feel like science - in my classes and my jobs and my extracurriculars - is a burden I'm trying to escape. 

Sure, I've devoted my whole life to science, I'm trying to get into grad school for science, but I also get depressed just thinking about a future doing this thing that I don't think I really enjoy. 

It sucks, I can't really tell if I'm good at science because I like it or because I'm just forcing myself to do it.",3,3
862,941,"I grew up in a very small farm town. So I didn't realize what a different experience I was living until I got to high school because we moved to Phoenix. And for the first time, I was so different because I went to a community in Phoenix where I was a minority. And that's when the labels came on. Like girl at risk or girl of color. And I was like that has nothing to do with my identity. 

And when I was growing up in Arizona, I happened to be introduced to the Girl Scouts. And at the age of 12 as a Girl Scout, that's when I discovered my passion around protecting the environment and our infrastructure for future generations. And literally because of that I decided at the age of 12 I wanted to become an attorney. 

Every time I've stepped into a new situation, I'm normally the first of. There hasn't been a long path of people before me to reach back and go, okay, here's the play book, go for it. And I guess I could have been scared about it, and I guess deep down I probably was. But because I grew up in an environment where my family, specifically the women in my family, were saying you're not going to have a play for everything. And you're gonna have to be a little scrappy, and sometimes you're gonna have to fake it before you make it. And it will all work out as long as you're always doing it for the right reason.",2,2
863,957,"I moved right here to New York as soon as I graduated. I waited for all my friends to graduate from school so that I could start something with them, something creative. And that's how I was lucky enough to meet Chris. I started up Back House and we got our show, and we got a space. That was an empty basement in the bottom of a bookshop on 40th street and we turned it into a blackbox theater. 

There are many times when I can remember just having a can of beans to eat for dinner. I called my mother for that $20 wire transfer way too many times. 

Yeah, its going to be hard, your heart's going to get broken. Embrace it. There is nothing more creative than a broken heart. Don't wallow in it, but embrace it, accept it for what it is. 

Absolutely, because it tests your limits if you didn't know that you were able to survive through something like that, which you are. All of you are completely capable of having your heart broken, of not having a job, of feeling like a failure. 

And overcoming that and being the success that you want to be.",3,3
864,958,"I had just finished my undergrad degree in environmental biology at UC Santa Barbara. I was going to take the summer off to go work on a shrimp boat in the Gulf of Texas and the motorcycle broke down in a place called Roswell, New Mexico. I had $60 on me and it wasn't enough to repair it so I had to stay in this small town and find work. 

I stayed in the home of an old woman who rented me a room for $25 a week. She happened to be a former journalist. She said, there's a reporter's job open at the local paper that'll pay you two bucks above minimum and they hired me on the strength of having a college degree. 

I knew nothing about journalism, and that completely took my life in a different path. It's easy to say find your passion but people don't appreciate as much the power of serendipity in their lives. 

Something has happened that's completely unexpected and it knocks you off kilter. What's your reaction? It might be irritation or frustration but when you look back on it ten years from now, you might say, wow. I'm really glad that happened because I have accumulated this since then in life experience.",2,2
865,964,"I took auto-shop in high school. And I loved it. I knew I was gonna be somewhere. I knew I wanted to race cars. I got out of high school, and I went to work for a Dodson dealership. I started delivering parts for the parts department at the Dodson dealership. And while I was racing, and taking cars apart, restoring cars, racing, all of that, I couldn't get enough of it. 

I went on to the import car and parts business. I bought and sold a few companies over that time. I ran a few companies. And here I am 44-years later, running the SEMA Garage. 

Along the way, I had lots of struggles sure. Everything from racing and crashing or blowing up engines. You've got to just keep trying, you can't let things let you down. 

When we were building this Maverick, we got about three quarters of the way through the project. You get to a point where you're laying awake late at night saying, is this thing ever going to get done? And you really just got to wake up every morning and push through it, and say, I'm not gonna let these things get in my way, you're gonna fail. But you're gonna pick yourself up and keep going.",2,2
866,965,"We are the founders of New York on Tech. New York on Tech is a nonprofit organization that is preparing the next generation of technology leaders emerging from New York City. We work with low opportunity youth and provide them with the technical training, the dedicated mentorship and the professional experiences that combined, create access to degrees and careers in technology. 

It's really about showing them that there is a space for them within technology. Anybody could teach you coding, but it's like how do you make coding relatable? I think that's something that we've done a phenomenal job at, and that's why our students are always really excited. 

The community I grew up in, a lot of people didn't know that there were opportunities for them after high school and so my vision was to always make it out and be something great. I just didn't know how I was gonna get there and it was education that got me out of there. 

I tend to know my audiences. We work with students who are so very much ingrained in the hip hop community. I'm still very much a hip hop head. I love it. That's a part of me that's never, ever gonna leave. 

And so when I'm with the students at New York on Tech, I really turn it on for them. Because they need to see relatability. If they are going to feel like there is a place for them in tech, then they need to see a Latina who's a hip hop head in tech. 

Own your greatness and things that make you different. And then create a space for other people to flourish in that greatness as well.",2,2
867,966,"I am King Carney here at Two Bit Circus. I handle building and bringing the games out to different events, whether they be conferences, conventions, private parties and different event type experiences. I have a ton of siblings. So growing up, we were always playing a lot of games with each other and talking a lot of trash, and pushing each other to our limits. 

My dad is also a bit of an interesting character, and would push hobbies and experiences on us. So he wasn't as much interested in whether or not we did our homework. It was, did you do something you've never done today? And, I think a lot of that has added up to something that has helped me do what I do today, which is run events and build games. 

My best advice for trying to get out of your comfort zone and learning new things is finding the hobbies that you enjoy doing and letting them keep you up at night, and even if you don't think anybody else is gonna like it, if you think it's gonna be awesome, there are a lot of other people who think it's gonna be awesome too.",2,2
868,974,"I started off in physics, electrical engineering. I got my masters in biomedical engineering. Then I started a construction company. And that was just a result of buying a house I could afford in my 20s, which was really broken down and needed a lot of work. And so I worked on it, and I loved that. I found I had a real passion for construction. So then I was trying to reconcile, construction biomedical engineering, not quite sure how that works together. 

All of that stopped completely when I had gotten married, and I had a baby three months early with cerebral palsy. He's now 11, so I realized as I was going to physical therapy with my son. I was getting so frustrated looking for things that were really gonna help my son. So we pulled together a team and created a device that I thought was going to help my son. It's a little wearable sensor. 

And my company Dynofit, that's what we have now. It's amazing, life is long. And you really have the opportunity to do a lot of different things. I don't really define myself as, I'm a this or I'm a that. I'm a lot of things, we all are.",2,2
869,98,"I had an experience where I shared an idea for a story I had with a now former friend and they just unsolicited pointed out the logical inaccuracy of a story idea I had which was so ignorant and hurtful. 

I get a lot of people have a ""go-getter"" mindset and want to point out how to improve or better your interests. but I feel like when I share my passions with people, these are my deepest and most intimate parts of me, it shows that I love someone enough to show them, to show them I'm capable of love and that to share it is to share and express joy. 

Especially when it comes to anything artistic(which arguably is anything someone is passionate about), it's not just the thing of itself, but the emotion, the meaning behind it that they're trying to convey. This meaning, so delicate and gentle, they can't even say out loud, but are trying to communicate to you in their own way. 

So when you say that you think that liking FNAF is stupid, writing poetry is a load of bull or you think some art isn't cutesy enough to your taste, they'll bite their tongue and take it, but don't be surprised if they don't share much about themselves with you anymore. 

Sometimes when someone tells you something they love to do, they just wanted to share that love with you. Don't turn around and burn them. Have some decency and respect them even if you don't like their interests.",3,3
870,980,"It's really easy to get caught up in believing that somebody else's life plan is the one that you should live by. I've been told authors don't make money, creative people don't make money. I thought if I get to the end of my life and what I've accomplished is paying off student loan debt and that's all I have to show for my time on the planet, I don't know that I could go to my grave peacefully. 

One of the things I think is important to think about when you start to consider the voices of the critics and naysayers and the people who you worry about what they think, is that they're not the ones that are gonna live with the consequences or the choices that you make. 

They're not the ones day in and day out who go and do a job that you hate. At the end of your life, they're not the ones who are going to be living with the life that you've lived and that has always kind of stuck with me. 

Compromising on what you want out of your life in order to silence a few people is a really high price to pay.",3,3
871,984,"When I was a senior in high school, I got in a really, really bad car accident and was hospitalized for quite a while and couldn't do anything for myself and had to rely on a lot of other people. And it just was a reality check for the importance of rehab and physical therapy and how to put your life back together after you have an accident or an injury like that. 

Simultaneously, what I really like to do is long distance running. And I've always loved horses. So there's this niche in the horse world called endurance riding. I was like, well I love running long distances and I really like horses, so maybe I'll try this long-distance endurance riding. 

And once I really got into that it was just kind of a natural fit for me to go physical therapy in horses, hippotherapy. Hippo comes from the Greek word which means horse. Hippotherapy is just the term that we refer to using the horse and therapy. It's very much I'm gonna figure out how to help your body or how to help your mind concentrate and focus. 

My freshman year was tough, because volleyball was very hard, but it forced me to kick it in gear. And you alway run into small hurdles. Maybe that day was a rough one. Maybe that week was a bad one. Maybe you fell and broke your arm and you had a couple bad months, but you can still be super successful. 

You gotta find success in the little things.",2,2
872,988,"Initially, I did not want to be a teacher. But as I went through school, I realized by the time I was in high school that I needed to be a teacher. The reason that I needed to be a teacher was because I loved school a lot. I loved learning a lot. But I didn't have a teacher that I really liked. 

I felt, at a young age that if I had had that kind of experience where I felt connected to my school, and connected to at least one teacher, I would've been an even better student and school would've been a better experience for me. 

I felt that when it was time for me to become a teacher, my job was not to be your friend but for you to know as strict as I was, that I still cared about you, and I cared about your achievement, and I cared about you as a human being. 

I've gotten to a place in my life where what is most important to me is to make a difference, no matter how small or how big, it's to make a difference. 

Whatever you decide to do with do in your lives, it has to be something that it becomes your life work. It has to be your life work. Because this world now is at a place where you can make money, you certainly can make money. And you can make a lot of money. But your life's work, a piece of it has to be able to help other people.",2,2
873,99,"After watching School of Life and painfully finding ways of filling up my own bucket, and cleansing my social media so as to not attract the wrong kind of ppl luring me into hookups when all I really want is love, and looking up literature on what healthy relationships could be, even when it was easier to remain dejected and pessimistic, I feel so proud of being in a place where I can be a giver of love. 

I still don’t believe in fairy tale endings because I know that there will be always be challenges in relationships and even bouts of getting so irritated with your partner - even in stellar marriages - but I believe in humility, respect, compassion, charity of interpretation, sincerity, understanding, vulnerability, kindness and integrity, and I believe that I can choose to creatively find ways of inviting joy and romance to my and my partner’s shared lives, and to acquire the wisdom and discernment to honor and generously apply those values. 

I feel sober and hopeful, which is more than my adolescent self and her emotionally turbulent experiences could hve dreamed of 

There really needs to be a class on love and relationships. Would save us all a lot of heartache.",3,3
